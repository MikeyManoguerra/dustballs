By some of these\n    The Queen is put in anger. Y'are excus'd.\n    But will you be more justified? You ever\n    Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desir'd\n    It to be stirr'd; but oft have hind'red, oft,\n    The passages made toward it. On my honour,\n    I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point,\n    And thus far clear him. Now, what mov'd me to't,\n    I will be bold with time and your attention.\n    Then mark th' inducement. Thus it came-give heed to't:\n    My conscience first receiv'd a tenderness,\n    Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd\n    By th' Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,\n    Who had been hither sent on the debating\n    A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and\n    Our daughter Mary. I' th' progress of this business,\n    Ere a determinate resolution, he-\n    I mean the Bishop-did require a respite\n    Wherein he might the King his lord advertise\n    Whether our daughter were legitimate,\n    Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,\n    Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook\n    The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,\n    Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble\n    The region of my breast, which forc'd such way\n    That many maz'd considerings did throng\n    And press'd in with this caution. First, methought\n    I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had\n    Commanded nature that my lady's womb,\n    If it conceiv'd a male child by me, should\n    Do no more offices of life to't than\n    The grave does to the dead; for her male issue\n    Or died where they were made, or shortly after\n    This world had air'd them. Hence I took a thought\n    This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom,\n    Well worthy the best heir o' th' world, should not\n    Be gladded in't by me. Then follows that\n    I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in\n    By this my issue's fail, and that gave to me\n    Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in\n    The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer\n    Toward this remedy, whereupon we are\n    Now present here together; that's to say\n    I meant to rectify my conscience, which\n    I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,\n    By all the reverend fathers of the land\n    And doctors learn'd.
