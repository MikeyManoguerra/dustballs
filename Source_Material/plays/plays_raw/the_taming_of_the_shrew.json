Ne\u2019er ask me what raiment I\u2019ll wear, for I have no more doublets\r\nthan backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet:\r\nnay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look\r\nthrough the over-leather.\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nHeaven cease this idle humour in your honour!\r\nO, that a mighty man of such descent,\r\nOf such possessions, and so high esteem,\r\nShould be infused with so foul a spirit!\r\n\r\nSLY.\r\nWhat! would you make me mad?

Servants, leave me and her alone.\r\nMadam, undress you, and come now to bed.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nThrice noble lord, let me entreat of you\r\nTo pardon me yet for a night or two;\r\nOr, if not so, until the sun be set:\r\nFor your physicians have expressly charg\u2019d,\r\nIn peril to incur your former malady,\r\nThat I should yet absent me from your bed:\r\nI hope this reason stands for my excuse.\r\n\r\nSLY.\r\nAy, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long; but I would be loath\r\nto fall into my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in despite of the\r\nflesh and the blood.\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nYour honour\u2019s players, hearing your amendment,\r\nAre come to play a pleasant comedy;\r\nFor so your doctors hold it very meet,\r\nSeeing too much sadness hath congeal\u2019d your blood,\r\nAnd melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:\r\nTherefore they thought it good you hear a play,\r\nAnd frame your mind to mirth and merriment,\r\nWhich bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.\r\n\r\nSLY.\r\nMarry, I will; let them play it. Is not a commonty a Christmas gambold\r\nor a tumbling-trick?\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nNo, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.\r\n\r\nSLY.\r\nWhat! household stuff?\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nIt is a kind of history.\r\n\r\nSLY.\r\nWell, we\u2019ll see\u2019t.

Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our\r\nnails together, and fast it fairly out; our cake\u2019s dough on both sides.\r\nFarewell: yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any\r\nmeans light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will\r\nwish him to her father.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nSo will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. Though the nature of our\r\nquarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us\r\nboth,\u2014that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be\r\nhappy rivals in Bianca\u2019s love,\u2014to labour and effect one thing\r\nspecially.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nWhat\u2019s that, I pray?\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nMarry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nA husband! a devil.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nI say, a husband.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nI say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her father be very\r\nrich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nTush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud\r\nalarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, and a man could\r\nlight on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nI cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to\r\nbe whipp\u2019d at the high cross every morning.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nFaith, as you say, there\u2019s small choice in rotten apples. But come;\r\nsince this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth\r\nfriendly maintained, till by helping Baptista\u2019s eldest daughter to a\r\nhusband, we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to\u2019t\r\nafresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets\r\nthe ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nI am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin\r\nhis wooing, that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and\r\nrid the house of her. Come on.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Gremio and Hortensio._]\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nI pray, sir, tell me, is it possible\r\nThat love should of a sudden take such hold?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nO Tranio! till I found it to be true,\r\nI never thought it possible or likely;\r\nBut see, while idly I stood looking on,\r\nI found the effect of love in idleness;\r\nAnd now in plainness do confess to thee,\r\nThat art to me as secret and as dear\r\nAs Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,\r\nTranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,\r\nIf I achieve not this young modest girl.\r\nCounsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst:\r\nAssist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nMaster, it is no time to chide you now;\r\nAffection is not rated from the heart:\r\nIf love have touch\u2019d you, nought remains but so:\r\n_Redime te captum quam queas minimo._\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nGramercies, lad; go forward; this contents;\r\nThe rest will comfort, for thy counsel\u2019s sound.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nMaster, you look\u2019d so longly on the maid.\r\nPerhaps you mark\u2019d not what\u2019s the pith of all.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nO, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,\r\nSuch as the daughter of Agenor had,\r\nThat made great Jove to humble him to her hand,\r\nWhen with his knees he kiss\u2019d the Cretan strand.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nSaw you no more? mark\u2019d you not how her sister\r\nBegan to scold and raise up such a storm\r\nThat mortal ears might hardly endure the din?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nTranio, I saw her coral lips to move,\r\nAnd with her breath she did perfume the air;\r\nSacred and sweet was all I saw in her.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nNay, then, \u2019tis time to stir him from his trance.\r\nI pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,\r\nBend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:\r\nHer elder sister is so curst and shrewd,\r\nThat till the father rid his hands of her,\r\nMaster, your love must live a maid at home;\r\nAnd therefore has he closely mew\u2019d her up,\r\nBecause she will not be annoy\u2019d with suitors.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nAh, Tranio, what a cruel father\u2019s he!\r\nBut art thou not advis\u2019d he took some care\r\nTo get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nAy, marry, am I, sir, and now \u2019tis plotted.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nI have it, Tranio.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nMaster, for my hand,\r\nBoth our inventions meet and jump in one.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nTell me thine first.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nYou will be schoolmaster,\r\nAnd undertake the teaching of the maid:\r\nThat\u2019s your device.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nIt is: may it be done?\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nNot possible; for who shall bear your part\r\nAnd be in Padua here Vincentio\u2019s son;\r\nKeep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;\r\nVisit his countrymen, and banquet them?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\n_Basta_, content thee, for I have it full.\r\nWe have not yet been seen in any house,\r\nNor can we be distinguish\u2019d by our faces\r\nFor man or master: then it follows thus:\r\nThou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,\r\nKeep house and port and servants, as I should;\r\nI will some other be; some Florentine,\r\nSome Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.\r\n\u2019Tis hatch\u2019d, and shall be so: Tranio, at once\r\nUncase thee; take my colour\u2019d hat and cloak.\r\nWhen Biondello comes, he waits on thee;\r\nBut I will charm him first to keep his tongue.\r\n\r\n[_They exchange habits_]\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nSo had you need.\r\nIn brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,\r\nAnd I am tied to be obedient;\r\nFor so your father charg\u2019d me at our parting,\r\n\u2018Be serviceable to my son,\u2019 quoth he,\r\nAlthough I think \u2019twas in another sense:\r\nI am content to be Lucentio,\r\nBecause so well I love Lucentio.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nTranio, be so, because Lucentio loves;\r\nAnd let me be a slave, to achieve that maid\r\nWhose sudden sight hath thrall\u2019d my wounded eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter Biondello.\r\n\r\nHere comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?\r\n\r\nBIONDELLO.\r\nWhere have I been? Nay, how now! where are you?\r\nMaster, has my fellow Tranio stol\u2019n your clothes?\r\nOr you stol\u2019n his? or both? Pray, what\u2019s the news?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nSirrah, come hither: \u2019tis no time to jest,\r\nAnd therefore frame your manners to the time.\r\nYour fellow Tranio here, to save my life,\r\nPuts my apparel and my count\u2019nance on,\r\nAnd I for my escape have put on his;\r\nFor in a quarrel since I came ashore\r\nI kill\u2019d a man, and fear I was descried.\r\nWait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,\r\nWhile I make way from hence to save my life.\r\nYou understand me?\r\n\r\nBIONDELLO.\r\nI, sir! Ne\u2019er a whit.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nAnd not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:\r\nTranio is changed to Lucentio.\r\n\r\nBIONDELLO.\r\nThe better for him: would I were so too!\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nSo could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,\r\nThat Lucentio indeed had Baptista\u2019s youngest daughter.\r\nBut, sirrah, not for my sake but your master\u2019s, I advise\r\nYou use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:\r\nWhen I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;\r\nBut in all places else your master, Lucentio.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nTranio, let\u2019s go.\r\nOne thing more rests, that thyself execute,\r\nTo make one among these wooers: if thou ask me why,\r\nSufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n[_The Presenters above speak._]\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT.\r\nMy lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.\r\n\r\nSLY.\r\nYes, by Saint Anne, I do.

Whom should I knock? Is there any man has rebused your\r\nworship?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nVillain, I say, knock me here soundly.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nKnock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you\r\nhere, sir?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nVillain, I say, knock me at this gate;\r\nAnd rap me well, or I\u2019ll knock your knave\u2019s pate.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nMy master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,\r\nAnd then I know after who comes by the worst.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nWill it not be?\r\nFaith, sirrah, and you\u2019ll not knock, I\u2019ll ring it;\r\nI\u2019ll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.\r\n\r\n[_He wrings Grumio by the ears._]\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nHelp, masters, help! my master is mad.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nNow, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter Hortensio.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nHow now! what\u2019s the matter? My old friend Grumio! and my good friend\r\nPetruchio! How do you all at Verona?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nSignior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?\r\n_Con tutto il cuore ben trovato_, may I say.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\n_Alla nostra casa ben venuto; molto honorato signor mio Petruchio._\r\nRise, Grumio, rise: we will compound this quarrel.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nNay, \u2019tis no matter, sir, what he \u2019leges in Latin. If this be not a\r\nlawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir, he bid me\r\nknock him and rap him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to\r\nuse his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a\r\npip out? Whom would to God I had well knock\u2019d at first, then had not\r\nGrumio come by the worst.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nA senseless villain! Good Hortensio,\r\nI bade the rascal knock upon your gate,\r\nAnd could not get him for my heart to do it.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nKnock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these words plain: \u2018Sirrah\r\nknock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly\u2019? And\r\ncome you now with \u2018knocking at the gate\u2019?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nSirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nPetruchio, patience; I am Grumio\u2019s pledge;\r\nWhy, this\u2019s a heavy chance \u2019twixt him and you,\r\nYour ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.\r\nAnd tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale\r\nBlows you to Padua here from old Verona?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nSuch wind as scatters young men through the world\r\nTo seek their fortunes farther than at home,\r\nWhere small experience grows. But in a few,\r\nSignior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:\r\nAntonio, my father, is deceas\u2019d,\r\nAnd I have thrust myself into this maze,\r\nHaply to wive and thrive as best I may;\r\nCrowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,\r\nAnd so am come abroad to see the world.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nPetruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee\r\nAnd wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour\u2019d wife?\r\nThou\u2019dst thank me but a little for my counsel;\r\nAnd yet I\u2019ll promise thee she shall be rich,\r\nAnd very rich: but th\u2019art too much my friend,\r\nAnd I\u2019ll not wish thee to her.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nSignior Hortensio, \u2019twixt such friends as we\r\nFew words suffice; and therefore, if thou know\r\nOne rich enough to be Petruchio\u2019s wife,\r\nAs wealth is burden of my wooing dance,\r\nBe she as foul as was Florentius\u2019 love,\r\nAs old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd\r\nAs Socrates\u2019 Xanthippe or a worse,\r\nShe moves me not, or not removes, at least,\r\nAffection\u2019s edge in me, were she as rough\r\nAs are the swelling Adriatic seas:\r\nI come to wive it wealthily in Padua;\r\nIf wealthily, then happily in Padua.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nNay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why, give him\r\ngold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot\r\nwith ne\u2019er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as\r\ntwo-and-fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nPetruchio, since we are stepp\u2019d thus far in,\r\nI will continue that I broach\u2019d in jest.\r\nI can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife\r\nWith wealth enough, and young and beauteous;\r\nBrought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:\r\nHer only fault,\u2014and that is faults enough,\u2014\r\nIs, that she is intolerable curst,\r\nAnd shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,\r\nThat, were my state far worser than it is,\r\nI would not wed her for a mine of gold.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nHortensio, peace! thou know\u2019st not gold\u2019s effect:\r\nTell me her father\u2019s name, and \u2019tis enough;\r\nFor I will board her, though she chide as loud\r\nAs thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nHer father is Baptista Minola,\r\nAn affable and courteous gentleman;\r\nHer name is Katherina Minola,\r\nRenown\u2019d in Padua for her scolding tongue.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nI know her father, though I know not her;\r\nAnd he knew my deceased father well.\r\nI will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;\r\nAnd therefore let me be thus bold with you,\r\nTo give you over at this first encounter,\r\nUnless you will accompany me thither.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nI pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O\u2019 my word, and she\r\nknew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good\r\nupon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so; why,\r\nthat\u2019s nothing; and he begin once, he\u2019ll rail in his rope-tricks. I\u2019ll\r\ntell you what, sir, and she stand him but a little, he will throw a\r\nfigure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no\r\nmore eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nTarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,\r\nFor in Baptista\u2019s keep my treasure is:\r\nHe hath the jewel of my life in hold,\r\nHis youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,\r\nAnd her withholds from me and other more,\r\nSuitors to her and rivals in my love;\r\nSupposing it a thing impossible,\r\nFor those defects I have before rehears\u2019d,\r\nThat ever Katherina will be woo\u2019d:\r\nTherefore this order hath Baptista ta\u2019en,\r\nThat none shall have access unto Bianca\r\nTill Katherine the curst have got a husband.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nKatherine the curst!\r\nA title for a maid of all titles the worst.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nNow shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,\r\nAnd offer me disguis\u2019d in sober robes,\r\nTo old Baptista as a schoolmaster\r\nWell seen in music, to instruct Bianca;\r\nThat so I may, by this device at least\r\nHave leave and leisure to make love to her,\r\nAnd unsuspected court her by herself.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nHere\u2019s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks\r\nlay their heads together!\r\n\r\nEnter Gremio and Lucentio disguised, with books under his arm.\r\n\r\nMaster, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nPeace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio, stand by awhile.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nA proper stripling, and an amorous!\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nO! very well; I have perus\u2019d the note.\r\nHark you, sir; I\u2019ll have them very fairly bound:\r\nAll books of love, see that at any hand,\r\nAnd see you read no other lectures to her.\r\nYou understand me. Over and beside\r\nSignior Baptista\u2019s liberality,\r\nI\u2019ll mend it with a largess. Take your papers too,\r\nAnd let me have them very well perfum\u2019d;\r\nFor she is sweeter than perfume itself\r\nTo whom they go to. What will you read to her?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nWhate\u2019er I read to her, I\u2019ll plead for you,\r\nAs for my patron, stand you so assur\u2019d,\r\nAs firmly as yourself were still in place;\r\nYea, and perhaps with more successful words\r\nThan you, unless you were a scholar, sir.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nO! this learning, what a thing it is.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nO! this woodcock, what an ass it is.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nPeace, sirrah!\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nGrumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio!\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nAnd you are well met, Signior Hortensio.\r\nTrow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.\r\nI promis\u2019d to enquire carefully\r\nAbout a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;\r\nAnd by good fortune I have lighted well\r\nOn this young man; for learning and behaviour\r\nFit for her turn, well read in poetry\r\nAnd other books, good ones, I warrant ye.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\n\u2019Tis well; and I have met a gentleman\r\nHath promis\u2019d me to help me to another,\r\nA fine musician to instruct our mistress:\r\nSo shall I no whit be behind in duty\r\nTo fair Bianca, so belov\u2019d of me.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nBelov\u2019d of me, and that my deeds shall prove.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\n[_Aside._] And that his bags shall prove.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nGremio, \u2019tis now no time to vent our love:\r\nListen to me, and if you speak me fair,\r\nI\u2019ll tell you news indifferent good for either.\r\nHere is a gentleman whom by chance I met,\r\nUpon agreement from us to his liking,\r\nWill undertake to woo curst Katherine;\r\nYea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nSo said, so done, is well.\r\nHortensio, have you told him all her faults?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nI know she is an irksome brawling scold;\r\nIf that be all, masters, I hear no harm.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nNo, say\u2019st me so, friend? What countryman?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nBorn in Verona, old Antonio\u2019s son.\r\nMy father dead, my fortune lives for me;\r\nAnd I do hope good days and long to see.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nO sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!\r\nBut if you have a stomach, to\u2019t a God\u2019s name;\r\nYou shall have me assisting you in all.\r\nBut will you woo this wild-cat?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nWill I live?\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nWill he woo her? Ay, or I\u2019ll hang her.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nWhy came I hither but to that intent?\r\nThink you a little din can daunt mine ears?\r\nHave I not in my time heard lions roar?\r\nHave I not heard the sea, puff\u2019d up with winds,\r\nRage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?\r\nHave I not heard great ordnance in the field,\r\nAnd heaven\u2019s artillery thunder in the skies?\r\nHave I not in a pitched battle heard\r\nLoud \u2019larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets\u2019 clang?\r\nAnd do you tell me of a woman\u2019s tongue,\r\nThat gives not half so great a blow to hear\r\nAs will a chestnut in a farmer\u2019s fire?\r\nTush, tush! fear boys with bugs.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\n[_Aside_] For he fears none.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nHortensio, hark:\r\nThis gentleman is happily arriv\u2019d,\r\nMy mind presumes, for his own good and yours.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nI promis\u2019d we would be contributors,\r\nAnd bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe\u2019er.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nAnd so we will, provided that he win her.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nI would I were as sure of a good dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter Tranio brave, and Biondello.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nGentlemen, God save you!

I wonder what it bodes.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nMarry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,\r\nAn awful rule, and right supremacy;\r\nAnd, to be short, what not that\u2019s sweet and happy.\r\n\r\nBAPTISTA.\r\nNow fair befall thee, good Petruchio!\r\nThe wager thou hast won; and I will add\r\nUnto their losses twenty thousand crowns;\r\nAnother dowry to another daughter,\r\nFor she is chang\u2019d, as she had never been.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nNay, I will win my wager better yet,\r\nAnd show more sign of her obedience,\r\nHer new-built virtue and obedience.\r\nSee where she comes, and brings your froward wives\r\nAs prisoners to her womanly persuasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nRe-enter Katherina with Bianca and Widow.\r\n\r\nKatherine, that cap of yours becomes you not:\r\nOff with that bauble, throw it underfoot.\r\n\r\n[_Katherina pulls off her cap and throws it down._]\r\n\r\nWIDOW.\r\nLord, let me never have a cause to sigh\r\nTill I be brought to such a silly pass!\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nFie! what a foolish duty call you this?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nI would your duty were as foolish too;\r\nThe wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,\r\nHath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nThe more fool you for laying on my duty.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nKatherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women\r\nWhat duty they do owe their lords and husbands.\r\n\r\nWIDOW.\r\nCome, come, you\u2019re mocking; we will have no telling.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nCome on, I say; and first begin with her.\r\n\r\nWIDOW.\r\nShe shall not.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nI say she shall: and first begin with her.\r\n\r\nKATHERINA.\r\nFie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,\r\nAnd dart not scornful glances from those eyes\r\nTo wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:\r\nIt blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,\r\nConfounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,\r\nAnd in no sense is meet or amiable.\r\nA woman mov\u2019d is like a fountain troubled,\r\nMuddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;\r\nAnd while it is so, none so dry or thirsty\r\nWill deign to sip or touch one drop of it.\r\nThy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,\r\nThy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,\r\nAnd for thy maintenance commits his body\r\nTo painful labour both by sea and land,\r\nTo watch the night in storms, the day in cold,\r\nWhilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;\r\nAnd craves no other tribute at thy hands\r\nBut love, fair looks, and true obedience;\r\nToo little payment for so great a debt.\r\nSuch duty as the subject owes the prince,\r\nEven such a woman oweth to her husband;\r\nAnd when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,\r\nAnd not obedient to his honest will,\r\nWhat is she but a foul contending rebel\r\nAnd graceless traitor to her loving lord?\u2014\r\nI am asham\u2019d that women are so simple\r\nTo offer war where they should kneel for peace,\r\nOr seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,\r\nWhen they are bound to serve, love, and obey.\r\nWhy are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,\r\nUnapt to toil and trouble in the world,\r\nBut that our soft conditions and our hearts\r\nShould well agree with our external parts?\r\nCome, come, you froward and unable worms!\r\nMy mind hath been as big as one of yours,\r\nMy heart as great, my reason haply more,\r\nTo bandy word for word and frown for frown;\r\nBut now I see our lances are but straws,\r\nOur strength as weak, our weakness past compare,\r\nThat seeming to be most which we indeed least are.\r\nThen vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,\r\nAnd place your hands below your husband\u2019s foot:\r\nIn token of which duty, if he please,\r\nMy hand is ready; may it do him ease.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nWhy, there\u2019s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nWell, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha\u2019t.\r\n\r\nVINCENTIO.\r\n\u2019Tis a good hearing when children are toward.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nBut a harsh hearing when women are froward.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nCome, Kate, we\u2019ll to bed.\r\nWe three are married, but you two are sped.\r\n\u2019Twas I won the wager,\r\n[_To Lucentio._] though you hit the white;\r\nAnd being a winner, God give you good night!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Petrucio and Katherina._]\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nNow go thy ways; thou hast tam\u2019d a curst shrew.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\n\u2019Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam\u2019d so.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r"
