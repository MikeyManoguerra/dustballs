A Camp near Forres.\r\n\r\n Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with\r\n Attendants, meeting a bleeding Captain.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nWhat bloody man is that? He can report,\r\nAs seemeth by his plight, of the revolt\r\nThe newest state.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nThis is the sergeant\r\nWho, like a good and hardy soldier, fought\r\n\u2019Gainst my captivity.\u2014Hail, brave friend!\r\nSay to the King the knowledge of the broil\r\nAs thou didst leave it.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER.\r\nDoubtful it stood;\r\nAs two spent swimmers that do cling together\r\nAnd choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald\r\n(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that\r\nThe multiplying villainies of nature\r\nDo swarm upon him) from the Western Isles\r\nOf kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;\r\nAnd Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,\r\nShow\u2019d like a rebel\u2019s whore. But all\u2019s too weak;\r\nFor brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),\r\nDisdaining Fortune, with his brandish\u2019d steel,\r\nWhich smok\u2019d with bloody execution,\r\nLike Valour\u2019s minion, carv\u2019d out his passage,\r\nTill he fac\u2019d the slave;\r\nWhich ne\u2019er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,\r\nTill he unseam\u2019d him from the nave to the chops,\r\nAnd fix\u2019d his head upon our battlements.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nO valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!\r\n\r\nSOLDIER.\r\nAs whence the sun \u2019gins his reflection\r\nShipwracking storms and direful thunders break,\r\nSo from that spring, whence comfort seem\u2019d to come\r\nDiscomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:\r\nNo sooner justice had, with valour arm\u2019d,\r\nCompell\u2019d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,\r\nBut the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,\r\nWith furbish\u2019d arms and new supplies of men,\r\nBegan a fresh assault.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nDismay\u2019d not this\r\nOur captains, Macbeth and Banquo?\r\n\r\nSOLDIER.\r\nYes;\r\nAs sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.\r\nIf I say sooth, I must report they were\r\nAs cannons overcharg\u2019d with double cracks;\r\nSo they\r\nDoubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:\r\nExcept they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,\r\nOr memorize another Golgotha,\r\nI cannot tell\u2014\r\nBut I am faint, my gashes cry for help.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nSo well thy words become thee as thy wounds:\r\nThey smack of honour both.\u2014Go, get him surgeons.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Captain, attended._]\r\n\r\n Enter Ross and Angus.\r\n\r\nWho comes here?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nThe worthy Thane of Ross.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nWhat a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look\r\nThat seems to speak things strange.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nGod save the King!\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nWhence cam\u2019st thou, worthy thane?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nFrom Fife, great King,\r\nWhere the Norweyan banners flout the sky\r\nAnd fan our people cold.\r\nNorway himself, with terrible numbers,\r\nAssisted by that most disloyal traitor,\r\nThe Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;\r\nTill that Bellona\u2019s bridegroom, lapp\u2019d in proof,\r\nConfronted him with self-comparisons,\r\nPoint against point, rebellious arm \u2019gainst arm,\r\nCurbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,\r\nThe victory fell on us.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nGreat happiness!\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nThat now\r\nSweno, the Norways\u2019 king, craves composition;\r\nNor would we deign him burial of his men\r\nTill he disbursed at Saint Colme\u2019s Inch\r\nTen thousand dollars to our general use.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nNo more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive\r\nOur bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,\r\nAnd with his former title greet Macbeth.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nI\u2019ll see it done.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nWhat he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

You seem to understand me,\r\nBy each at once her choppy finger laying\r\nUpon her skinny lips. You should be women,\r\nAnd yet your beards forbid me to interpret\r\nThat you are so.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nSpeak, if you can;\u2014what are you?\r\n\r\nFIRST WITCH.\r\nAll hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!\r\n\r\nSECOND WITCH.\r\nAll hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!\r\n\r\nTHIRD WITCH.\r\nAll hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nGood sir, why do you start and seem to fear\r\nThings that do sound so fair?\u2014I\u2019 th\u2019 name of truth,\r\nAre ye fantastical, or that indeed\r\nWhich outwardly ye show? My noble partner\r\nYou greet with present grace and great prediction\r\nOf noble having and of royal hope,\r\nThat he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.\r\nIf you can look into the seeds of time,\r\nAnd say which grain will grow, and which will not,\r\nSpeak then to me, who neither beg nor fear\r\nYour favours nor your hate.\r\n\r\nFIRST WITCH.\r\nHail!\r\n\r\nSECOND WITCH.\r\nHail!\r\n\r\nTHIRD WITCH.\r\nHail!\r\n\r\nFIRST WITCH.\r\nLesser than Macbeth, and greater.\r\n\r\nSECOND WITCH.\r\nNot so happy, yet much happier.\r\n\r\nTHIRD WITCH.\r\nThou shalt get kings, though thou be none:\r\nSo all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!\r\n\r\nFIRST WITCH.\r\nBanquo and Macbeth, all hail!\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nStay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.\r\nBy Sinel\u2019s death I know I am Thane of Glamis;\r\nBut how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,\r\nA prosperous gentleman; and to be king\r\nStands not within the prospect of belief,\r\nNo more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence\r\nYou owe this strange intelligence? or why\r\nUpon this blasted heath you stop our way\r\nWith such prophetic greeting?\u2014Speak, I charge you.\r\n\r\n [_Witches vanish._]\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nThe earth hath bubbles, as the water has,\r\nAnd these are of them. Whither are they vanish\u2019d?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nInto the air; and what seem\u2019d corporal,\r\nMelted as breath into the wind.\r\nWould they had stay\u2019d!\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nWere such things here as we do speak about?\r\nOr have we eaten on the insane root\r\nThat takes the reason prisoner?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nYour children shall be kings.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nYou shall be king.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nAnd Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nTo the selfsame tune and words. Who\u2019s here?\r\n\r\n Enter Ross and Angus.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nThe King hath happily receiv\u2019d, Macbeth,\r\nThe news of thy success, and when he reads\r\nThy personal venture in the rebels\u2019 fight,\r\nHis wonders and his praises do contend\r\nWhich should be thine or his: silenc\u2019d with that,\r\nIn viewing o\u2019er the rest o\u2019 th\u2019 selfsame day,\r\nHe finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,\r\nNothing afeard of what thyself didst make,\r\nStrange images of death. As thick as tale\r\nCame post with post; and everyone did bear\r\nThy praises in his kingdom\u2019s great defence,\r\nAnd pour\u2019d them down before him.\r\n\r\nANGUS.\r\nWe are sent\r\nTo give thee from our royal master thanks;\r\nOnly to herald thee into his sight,\r\nNot pay thee.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nAnd, for an earnest of a greater honour,\r\nHe bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:\r\nIn which addition, hail, most worthy thane,\r\nFor it is thine.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nWhat, can the devil speak true?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThe Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me\r\nIn borrow\u2019d robes?\r\n\r\nANGUS.\r\nWho was the Thane lives yet,\r\nBut under heavy judgement bears that life\r\nWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin\u2019d\r\nWith those of Norway, or did line the rebel\r\nWith hidden help and vantage, or that with both\r\nHe labour\u2019d in his country\u2019s wrack, I know not;\r\nBut treasons capital, confess\u2019d and prov\u2019d,\r\nHave overthrown him.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\n[_Aside._] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:\r\nThe greatest is behind. [_To Ross and Angus._] Thanks for your pains.\r\n[_To Banquo._] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,\r\nWhen those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me\r\nPromis\u2019d no less to them?\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nThat, trusted home,\r\nMight yet enkindle you unto the crown,\r\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But \u2019tis strange:\r\nAnd oftentimes to win us to our harm,\r\nThe instruments of darkness tell us truths;\r\nWin us with honest trifles, to betray\u2019s\r\nIn deepest consequence.\u2014\r\nCousins, a word, I pray you.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\n[_Aside._] Two truths are told,\r\nAs happy prologues to the swelling act\r\nOf the imperial theme.\u2014I thank you, gentlemen.\u2014\r\n[_Aside._] This supernatural soliciting\r\nCannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,\r\nWhy hath it given me earnest of success,\r\nCommencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:\r\nIf good, why do I yield to that suggestion\r\nWhose horrid image doth unfix my hair,\r\nAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs,\r\nAgainst the use of nature? Present fears\r\nAre less than horrible imaginings.\r\nMy thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,\r\nShakes so my single state of man\r\nThat function is smother\u2019d in surmise,\r\nAnd nothing is but what is not.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nLook, how our partner\u2019s rapt.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\n[_Aside._] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me\r\nWithout my stir.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nNew honours come upon him,\r\nLike our strange garments, cleave not to their mould\r\nBut with the aid of use.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\n[_Aside._] Come what come may,\r\nTime and the hour runs through the roughest day.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nWorthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nGive me your favour. My dull brain was wrought\r\nWith things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains\r\nAre register\u2019d where every day I turn\r\nThe leaf to read them.\u2014Let us toward the King.\u2014\r\nThink upon what hath chanc\u2019d; and at more time,\r\nThe interim having weigh\u2019d it, let us speak\r\nOur free hearts each to other.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nVery gladly.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nTill then, enough.\u2014Come, friends.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Forres. A Room in the Palace.\r\n\r\n Flourish. Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox and Attendants.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nIs execution done on Cawdor? Are not\r\nThose in commission yet return\u2019d?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nMy liege,\r\nThey are not yet come back. But I have spoke\r\nWith one that saw him die, who did report,\r\nThat very frankly he confess\u2019d his treasons,\r\nImplor\u2019d your Highness\u2019 pardon, and set forth\r\nA deep repentance. Nothing in his life\r\nBecame him like the leaving it; he died\r\nAs one that had been studied in his death,\r\nTo throw away the dearest thing he ow\u2019d\r\nAs \u2019twere a careless trifle.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nThere\u2019s no art\r\nTo find the mind\u2019s construction in the face:\r\nHe was a gentleman on whom I built\r\nAn absolute trust.\r\n\r\n Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross and Angus.\r\n\r\nO worthiest cousin!\r\nThe sin of my ingratitude even now\r\nWas heavy on me. Thou art so far before,\r\nThat swiftest wing of recompense is slow\r\nTo overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv\u2019d;\r\nThat the proportion both of thanks and payment\r\nMight have been mine! only I have left to say,\r\nMore is thy due than more than all can pay.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThe service and the loyalty I owe,\r\nIn doing it, pays itself. Your Highness\u2019 part\r\nIs to receive our duties: and our duties\r\nAre to your throne and state, children and servants;\r\nWhich do but what they should, by doing everything\r\nSafe toward your love and honour.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nWelcome hither:\r\nI have begun to plant thee, and will labour\r\nTo make thee full of growing.\u2014Noble Banquo,\r\nThat hast no less deserv\u2019d, nor must be known\r\nNo less to have done so, let me infold thee\r\nAnd hold thee to my heart.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nThere if I grow,\r\nThe harvest is your own.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nMy plenteous joys,\r\nWanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves\r\nIn drops of sorrow.\u2014Sons, kinsmen, thanes,\r\nAnd you whose places are the nearest, know,\r\nWe will establish our estate upon\r\nOur eldest, Malcolm; whom we name hereafter\r\nThe Prince of Cumberland: which honour must\r\nNot unaccompanied invest him only,\r\nBut signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine\r\nOn all deservers.\u2014From hence to Inverness,\r\nAnd bind us further to you.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThe rest is labour, which is not us\u2019d for you:\r\nI\u2019ll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful\r\nThe hearing of my wife with your approach;\r\nSo, humbly take my leave.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nMy worthy Cawdor!\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\n[_Aside._] The Prince of Cumberland!\u2014That is a step\r\nOn which I must fall down, or else o\u2019erleap,\r\nFor in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires!\r\nLet not light see my black and deep desires.\r\nThe eye wink at the hand, yet let that be,\r\nWhich the eye fears, when it is done, to see.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nTrue, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant;\r\nAnd in his commendations I am fed.\r\nIt is a banquet to me. Let\u2019s after him,\r\nWhose care is gone before to bid us welcome:\r\nIt is a peerless kinsman.\r\n\r\n [_Flourish. Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. Inverness. A Room in Macbeth\u2019s Castle.\r\n\r\n Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\n\u201cThey met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the\r\nperfect\u2019st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I\r\nburned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air,\r\ninto which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came\r\nmissives from the King, who all-hailed me, \u2018Thane of Cawdor\u2019; by which\r\ntitle, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the\r\ncoming on of time, with \u2018Hail, king that shalt be!\u2019 This have I thought\r\ngood to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou\r\nmight\u2019st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what\r\ngreatness is promis\u2019d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.\u201d\r\n\r\nGlamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be\r\nWhat thou art promis\u2019d. Yet do I fear thy nature;\r\nIt is too full o\u2019 th\u2019 milk of human kindness\r\nTo catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;\r\nArt not without ambition, but without\r\nThe illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,\r\nThat wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,\r\nAnd yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou\u2019dst have, great Glamis,\r\nThat which cries, \u201cThus thou must do,\u201d if thou have it;\r\nAnd that which rather thou dost fear to do,\r\nThan wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,\r\nThat I may pour my spirits in thine ear,\r\nAnd chastise with the valour of my tongue\r\nAll that impedes thee from the golden round,\r\nWhich fate and metaphysical aid doth seem\r\nTo have thee crown\u2019d withal.\r\n\r\n Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nWhat is your tidings?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nThe King comes here tonight.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nThou\u2019rt mad to say it.\r\nIs not thy master with him? who, were\u2019t so,\r\nWould have inform\u2019d for preparation.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nSo please you, it is true. Our thane is coming.\r\nOne of my fellows had the speed of him,\r\nWho, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more\r\nThan would make up his message.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nGive him tending.\r\nHe brings great news.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Messenger._]\r\n\r\nThe raven himself is hoarse\r\nThat croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan\r\nUnder my battlements. Come, you spirits\r\nThat tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,\r\nAnd fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full\r\nOf direst cruelty! make thick my blood,\r\nStop up th\u2019 access and passage to remorse,\r\nThat no compunctious visitings of nature\r\nShake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between\r\nTh\u2019 effect and it! Come to my woman\u2019s breasts,\r\nAnd take my milk for gall, your murd\u2019ring ministers,\r\nWherever in your sightless substances\r\nYou wait on nature\u2019s mischief! Come, thick night,\r\nAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell\r\nThat my keen knife see not the wound it makes,\r\nNor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark\r\nTo cry, \u201cHold, hold!\u201d\r\n\r\n Enter Macbeth.\r\n\r\nGreat Glamis, worthy Cawdor!\r\nGreater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!\r\nThy letters have transported me beyond\r\nThis ignorant present, and I feel now\r\nThe future in the instant.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nMy dearest love,\r\nDuncan comes here tonight.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nAnd when goes hence?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nTomorrow, as he purposes.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nO, never\r\nShall sun that morrow see!\r\nYour face, my thane, is as a book where men\r\nMay read strange matters. To beguile the time,\r\nLook like the time; bear welcome in your eye,\r\nYour hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,\r\nBut be the serpent under\u2019t. He that\u2019s coming\r\nMust be provided for; and you shall put\r\nThis night\u2019s great business into my dispatch;\r\nWhich shall to all our nights and days to come\r\nGive solely sovereign sway and masterdom.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWe will speak further.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nOnly look up clear;\r\nTo alter favour ever is to fear.\r\nLeave all the rest to me.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI.

Servants of Macbeth attending.\r\n\r\n Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross, Angus\r\n and Attendants.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nThis castle hath a pleasant seat. The air\r\nNimbly and sweetly recommends itself\r\nUnto our gentle senses.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nThis guest of summer,\r\nThe temple-haunting martlet, does approve,\r\nBy his loved mansionry, that the heaven\u2019s breath\r\nSmells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,\r\nButtress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird\r\nhath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.\r\nWhere they most breed and haunt, I have observ\u2019d\r\nThe air is delicate.\r\n\r\n Enter Lady Macbeth.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nSee, see, our honour\u2019d hostess!\u2014\r\nThe love that follows us sometime is our trouble,\r\nWhich still we thank as love. Herein I teach you\r\nHow you shall bid God \u2019ild us for your pains,\r\nAnd thank us for your trouble.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nAll our service,\r\nIn every point twice done, and then done double,\r\nWere poor and single business to contend\r\nAgainst those honours deep and broad wherewith\r\nYour Majesty loads our house: for those of old,\r\nAnd the late dignities heap\u2019d up to them,\r\nWe rest your hermits.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nWhere\u2019s the Thane of Cawdor?\r\nWe cours\u2019d him at the heels, and had a purpose\r\nTo be his purveyor: but he rides well;\r\nAnd his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him\r\nTo his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,\r\nWe are your guest tonight.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nYour servants ever\r\nHave theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,\r\nTo make their audit at your Highness\u2019 pleasure,\r\nStill to return your own.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nGive me your hand;\r\nConduct me to mine host: we love him highly,\r\nAnd shall continue our graces towards him.\r\nBy your leave, hostess.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VII. The same. A Lobby in the Castle.\r\n\r\n Hautboys and torches. Enter, and pass over, a Sewer and divers\r\n Servants with dishes and service. Then enter Macbeth.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nIf it were done when \u2019tis done, then \u2019twere well\r\nIt were done quickly. If th\u2019 assassination\r\nCould trammel up the consequence, and catch\r\nWith his surcease success; that but this blow\r\nMight be the be-all and the end-all\u2014here,\r\nBut here, upon this bank and shoal of time,\r\nWe\u2019d jump the life to come. But in these cases\r\nWe still have judgement here; that we but teach\r\nBloody instructions, which being taught, return\r\nTo plague th\u2019 inventor. This even-handed justice\r\nCommends th\u2019 ingredience of our poison\u2019d chalice\r\nTo our own lips. He\u2019s here in double trust:\r\nFirst, as I am his kinsman and his subject,\r\nStrong both against the deed; then, as his host,\r\nWho should against his murderer shut the door,\r\nNot bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan\r\nHath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\r\nSo clear in his great office, that his virtues\r\nWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against\r\nThe deep damnation of his taking-off;\r\nAnd pity, like a naked new-born babe,\r\nStriding the blast, or heaven\u2019s cherubin, hors\u2019d\r\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air,\r\nShall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\r\nThat tears shall drown the wind.\u2014I have no spur\r\nTo prick the sides of my intent, but only\r\nVaulting ambition, which o\u2019erleaps itself\r\nAnd falls on th\u2019 other\u2014\r\n\r\n Enter Lady Macbeth.\r\n\r\nHow now! what news?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nHe has almost supp\u2019d. Why have you left the chamber?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nHath he ask\u2019d for me?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nKnow you not he has?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWe will proceed no further in this business:\r\nHe hath honour\u2019d me of late; and I have bought\r\nGolden opinions from all sorts of people,\r\nWhich would be worn now in their newest gloss,\r\nNot cast aside so soon.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWas the hope drunk\r\nWherein you dress\u2019d yourself? Hath it slept since?\r\nAnd wakes it now, to look so green and pale\r\nAt what it did so freely? From this time\r\nSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeard\r\nTo be the same in thine own act and valour\r\nAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\r\nWhich thou esteem\u2019st the ornament of life,\r\nAnd live a coward in thine own esteem,\r\nLetting \u201cI dare not\u201d wait upon \u201cI would,\u201d\r\nLike the poor cat i\u2019 th\u2019 adage?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nPr\u2019ythee, peace!\r\nI dare do all that may become a man;\r\nWho dares do more is none.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWhat beast was\u2019t, then,\r\nThat made you break this enterprise to me?\r\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man;\r\nAnd, to be more than what you were, you would\r\nBe so much more the man. Nor time nor place\r\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\r\nThey have made themselves, and that their fitness now\r\nDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and know\r\nHow tender \u2019tis to love the babe that milks me:\r\nI would, while it was smiling in my face,\r\nHave pluck\u2019d my nipple from his boneless gums\r\nAnd dash\u2019d the brains out, had I so sworn as you\r\nHave done to this.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nIf we should fail?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWe fail?\r\nBut screw your courage to the sticking-place,\r\nAnd we\u2019ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep\r\n(Whereto the rather shall his day\u2019s hard journey\r\nSoundly invite him), his two chamberlains\r\nWill I with wine and wassail so convince\r\nThat memory, the warder of the brain,\r\nShall be a fume, and the receipt of reason\r\nA limbeck only: when in swinish sleep\r\nTheir drenched natures lie as in a death,\r\nWhat cannot you and I perform upon\r\nTh\u2019 unguarded Duncan? what not put upon\r\nHis spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt\r\nOf our great quell?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nBring forth men-children only;\r\nFor thy undaunted mettle should compose\r\nNothing but males. Will it not be receiv\u2019d,\r\nWhen we have mark\u2019d with blood those sleepy two\r\nOf his own chamber, and us\u2019d their very daggers,\r\nThat they have done\u2019t?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWho dares receive it other,\r\nAs we shall make our griefs and clamour roar\r\nUpon his death?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI am settled, and bend up\r\nEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.\r\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show:\r\nFalse face must hide what the false heart doth know.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II.\r\n\r\nSCENE I.

The King\u2019s abed:\r\nHe hath been in unusual pleasure and\r\nSent forth great largess to your offices.\r\nThis diamond he greets your wife withal,\r\nBy the name of most kind hostess, and shut up\r\nIn measureless content.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nBeing unprepar\u2019d,\r\nOur will became the servant to defect,\r\nWhich else should free have wrought.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nAll\u2019s well.\r\nI dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters:\r\nTo you they have show\u2019d some truth.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI think not of them:\r\nYet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,\r\nWe would spend it in some words upon that business,\r\nIf you would grant the time.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nAt your kind\u2019st leisure.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nIf you shall cleave to my consent, when \u2019tis,\r\nIt shall make honour for you.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nSo I lose none\r\nIn seeking to augment it, but still keep\r\nMy bosom franchis\u2019d, and allegiance clear,\r\nI shall be counsell\u2019d.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nGood repose the while!\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nThanks, sir: the like to you.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Banquo and Fleance._]\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nGo bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,\r\nShe strike upon the bell.

Come, let me clutch thee:\u2014\r\nI have thee not, and yet I see thee still.\r\nArt thou not, fatal vision, sensible\r\nTo feeling as to sight? or art thou but\r\nA dagger of the mind, a false creation,\r\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?\r\nI see thee yet, in form as palpable\r\nAs this which now I draw.\r\nThou marshall\u2019st me the way that I was going;\r\nAnd such an instrument I was to use.\r\nMine eyes are made the fools o\u2019 the other senses,\r\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\r\nAnd on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,\r\nWhich was not so before.\u2014There\u2019s no such thing.\r\nIt is the bloody business which informs\r\nThus to mine eyes.\u2014Now o\u2019er the one half-world\r\nNature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse\r\nThe curtain\u2019d sleep. Witchcraft celebrates\r\nPale Hecate\u2019s off\u2019rings; and wither\u2019d murder,\r\nAlarum\u2019d by his sentinel, the wolf,\r\nWhose howl\u2019s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\r\nWith Tarquin\u2019s ravishing strides, towards his design\r\nMoves like a ghost.\u2014Thou sure and firm-set earth,\r\nHear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear\r\nThy very stones prate of my whereabout,\r\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\r\nWhich now suits with it.\u2014Whiles I threat, he lives.\r\nWords to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.\r\n\r\n [_A bell rings._]\r\n\r\nI go, and it is done.

Who\u2019s there, i\u2019\r\nth\u2019 other devil\u2019s name? Faith, here\u2019s an equivocator, that could swear\r\nin both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough\r\nfor God\u2019s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in,\r\nequivocator. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock! Who\u2019s there? Faith,\r\nhere\u2019s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French\r\nhose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._]\r\nKnock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?\u2014But this place is too cold\r\nfor hell.

Lechery, sir, it provokes\r\nand unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the\r\nperformance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with\r\nlechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes\r\nhim off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and\r\nnot stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him\r\nthe lie, leaves him.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nThat it did, sir, i\u2019 the very throat on me; but I requited him for his\r\nlie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs\r\nsometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nIs thy master stirring?\r\n\r\n Enter Macbeth.\r\n\r\nOur knocking has awak\u2019d him; here he comes.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nGood morrow, noble sir!\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nGood morrow, both!\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nIs the King stirring, worthy thane?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nNot yet.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nHe did command me to call timely on him.\r\nI have almost slipp\u2019d the hour.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI\u2019ll bring you to him.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI know this is a joyful trouble to you;\r\nBut yet \u2019tis one.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThe labour we delight in physics pain.\r\nThis is the door.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI\u2019ll make so bold to call.\r\nFor \u2019tis my limited service.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Macduff._]\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nGoes the King hence today?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nHe does.

There is none but he\r\nWhose being I do fear: and under him\r\nMy genius is rebuk\u2019d; as, it is said,\r\nMark Antony\u2019s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters\r\nWhen first they put the name of king upon me,\r\nAnd bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,\r\nThey hail\u2019d him father to a line of kings:\r\nUpon my head they plac\u2019d a fruitless crown,\r\nAnd put a barren sceptre in my gripe,\r\nThence to be wrench\u2019d with an unlineal hand,\r\nNo son of mine succeeding. If\u2019t be so,\r\nFor Banquo\u2019s issue have I fil\u2019d my mind;\r\nFor them the gracious Duncan have I murder\u2019d;\r\nPut rancours in the vessel of my peace\r\nOnly for them; and mine eternal jewel\r\nGiven to the common enemy of man,\r\nTo make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!\r\nRather than so, come, fate, into the list,\r\nAnd champion me to th\u2019 utterance!\u2014Who\u2019s there?\u2014\r\n\r\n Enter Servant with two Murderers.\r\n\r\nNow go to the door, and stay there till we call.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nIt was, so please your Highness.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWell then, now\r\nHave you consider\u2019d of my speeches?

Do you find\r\nYour patience so predominant in your nature,\r\nThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell\u2019d,\r\nTo pray for this good man and for his issue,\r\nWhose heavy hand hath bow\u2019d you to the grave,\r\nAnd beggar\u2019d yours forever?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nWe are men, my liege.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nAy, in the catalogue ye go for men;\r\nAs hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\r\nShoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept\r\nAll by the name of dogs: the valu\u2019d file\r\nDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\r\nThe housekeeper, the hunter, every one\r\nAccording to the gift which bounteous nature\r\nHath in him clos\u2019d; whereby he does receive\r\nParticular addition, from the bill\r\nThat writes them all alike: and so of men.\r\nNow, if you have a station in the file,\r\nNot i\u2019 th\u2019 worst rank of manhood, say\u2019t;\r\nAnd I will put that business in your bosoms,\r\nWhose execution takes your enemy off,\r\nGrapples you to the heart and love of us,\r\nWho wear our health but sickly in his life,\r\nWhich in his death were perfect.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nI am one, my liege,\r\nWhom the vile blows and buffets of the world\r\nHath so incens\u2019d that I am reckless what\r\nI do to spite the world.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nAnd I another,\r\nSo weary with disasters, tugg\u2019d with fortune,\r\nThat I would set my life on any chance,\r\nTo mend it or be rid on\u2019t.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nBoth of you\r\nKnow Banquo was your enemy.\r\n\r\nBOTH MURDERERS.\r\nTrue, my lord.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nSo is he mine; and in such bloody distance,\r\nThat every minute of his being thrusts\r\nAgainst my near\u2019st of life; and though I could\r\nWith barefac\u2019d power sweep him from my sight,\r\nAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\r\nFor certain friends that are both his and mine,\r\nWhose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\r\nWho I myself struck down: and thence it is\r\nThat I to your assistance do make love,\r\nMasking the business from the common eye\r\nFor sundry weighty reasons.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nWe shall, my lord,\r\nPerform what you command us.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nThough our lives\u2014\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nYour spirits shine through you.

And with him\r\n(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)\r\nFleance his son, that keeps him company,\r\nWhose absence is no less material to me\r\nThan is his father\u2019s, must embrace the fate\r\nOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.\r\nI\u2019ll come to you anon.\r\n\r\nBOTH MURDERERS.\r\nWe are resolv\u2019d, my lord.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI\u2019ll call upon you straight: abide within.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Murderers._]\r\n\r\nIt is concluded.

Things without all remedy\r\nShould be without regard: what\u2019s done is done.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWe have scorch\u2019d the snake, not kill\u2019d it.\r\nShe\u2019ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice\r\nRemains in danger of her former tooth.\r\nBut let the frame of things disjoint,\r\nBoth the worlds suffer,\r\nEre we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep\r\nIn the affliction of these terrible dreams\r\nThat shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,\r\nWhom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\r\nThan on the torture of the mind to lie\r\nIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;\r\nAfter life\u2019s fitful fever he sleeps well;\r\nTreason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,\r\nMalice domestic, foreign levy, nothing\r\nCan touch him further.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nCome on,\r\nGently my lord, sleek o\u2019er your rugged looks;\r\nBe bright and jovial among your guests tonight.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nSo shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.\r\nLet your remembrance apply to Banquo;\r\nPresent him eminence, both with eye and tongue:\r\nUnsafe the while, that we\r\nMust lave our honours in these flattering streams,\r\nAnd make our faces vizards to our hearts,\r\nDisguising what they are.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nYou must leave this.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nO, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!\r\nThou know\u2019st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nBut in them nature\u2019s copy\u2019s not eterne.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThere\u2019s comfort yet; they are assailable.\r\nThen be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown\r\nHis cloister\u2019d flight, ere to black Hecate\u2019s summons\r\nThe shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,\r\nHath rung night\u2019s yawning peal, there shall be done\r\nA deed of dreadful note.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWhat\u2019s to be done?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nBe innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,\r\nTill thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,\r\nScarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,\r\nAnd with thy bloody and invisible hand\r\nCancel and tear to pieces that great bond\r\nWhich keeps me pale!\u2014Light thickens; and the crow\r\nMakes wing to th\u2019 rooky wood.\r\nGood things of day begin to droop and drowse,\r\nWhiles night\u2019s black agents to their preys do rouse.\r\nThou marvell\u2019st at my words: but hold thee still;\r\nThings bad begun make strong themselves by ill.\r\nSo, pr\u2019ythee, go with me.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

The gracious Duncan\r\nWas pitied of Macbeth:\u2014marry, he was dead:\u2014\r\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk\u2019d too late;\r\nWhom, you may say, if\u2019t please you, Fleance kill\u2019d,\r\nFor Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.\r\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\r\nIt was for Malcolm and for Donalbain\r\nTo kill their gracious father? damned fact!\r\nHow it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,\r\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents tear\r\nThat were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?\r\nWas not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;\r\nFor \u2019twould have anger\u2019d any heart alive,\r\nTo hear the men deny\u2019t. So that, I say,\r\nHe has borne all things well: and I do think,\r\nThat had he Duncan\u2019s sons under his key\r\n(As, and\u2019t please heaven, he shall not) they should find\r\nWhat \u2019twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.\r\nBut, peace!\u2014for from broad words, and \u2019cause he fail\u2019d\r\nHis presence at the tyrant\u2019s feast, I hear,\r\nMacduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\r\nWhere he bestows himself?\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nThe son of Duncan,\r\nFrom whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,\r\nLives in the English court and is receiv\u2019d\r\nOf the most pious Edward with such grace\r\nThat the malevolence of fortune nothing\r\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduff\r\nIs gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid\r\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward\r\nThat, by the help of these (with Him above\r\nTo ratify the work), we may again\r\nGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;\r\nFree from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\r\nDo faithful homage, and receive free honours,\r\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\r\nHath so exasperate the King that he\r\nPrepares for some attempt of war.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nSent he to Macduff?\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nHe did: and with an absolute \u201cSir, not I,\u201d\r\nThe cloudy messenger turns me his back,\r\nAnd hums, as who should say, \u201cYou\u2019ll rue the time\r\nThat clogs me with this answer.\u201d\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nAnd that well might\r\nAdvise him to a caution, t\u2019 hold what distance\r\nHis wisdom can provide. Some holy angel\r\nFly to the court of England, and unfold\r\nHis message ere he come, that a swift blessing\r\nMay soon return to this our suffering country\r\nUnder a hand accurs\u2019d!\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nI\u2019ll send my prayers with him.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\nACT IV.\r\n\r\nSCENE I.

He loves us not:\r\nHe wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,\r\nThe most diminutive of birds, will fight,\r\nHer young ones in her nest, against the owl.\r\nAll is the fear, and nothing is the love;\r\nAs little is the wisdom, where the flight\r\nSo runs against all reason.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nMy dearest coz,\r\nI pray you, school yourself: but, for your husband,\r\nHe is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows\r\nThe fits o\u2019 th\u2019 season.

Before the King\u2019s Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Malcolm and Macduff.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nLet us seek out some desolate shade and there\r\nWeep our sad bosoms empty.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nLet us rather\r\nHold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,\r\nBestride our down-fall\u2019n birthdom. Each new morn\r\nNew widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows\r\nStrike heaven on the face, that it resounds\r\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell\u2019d out\r\nLike syllable of dolour.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nWhat I believe, I\u2019ll wail;\r\nWhat know, believe; and what I can redress,\r\nAs I shall find the time to friend, I will.\r\nWhat you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.\r\nThis tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\r\nWas once thought honest: you have loved him well;\r\nHe hath not touch\u2019d you yet. I am young; but something\r\nYou may deserve of him through me; and wisdom\r\nTo offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb\r\nTo appease an angry god.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI am not treacherous.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBut Macbeth is.\r\nA good and virtuous nature may recoil\r\nIn an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.\r\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.\r\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell:\r\nThough all things foul would wear the brows of grace,\r\nYet grace must still look so.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI have lost my hopes.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nPerchance even there where I did find my doubts.\r\nWhy in that rawness left you wife and child,\r\nThose precious motives, those strong knots of love,\r\nWithout leave-taking?\u2014I pray you,\r\nLet not my jealousies be your dishonours,\r\nBut mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,\r\nWhatever I shall think.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nBleed, bleed, poor country!\r\nGreat tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,\r\nFor goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;\r\nThe title is affeer\u2019d.\u2014Fare thee well, lord:\r\nI would not be the villain that thou think\u2019st\r\nFor the whole space that\u2019s in the tyrant\u2019s grasp\r\nAnd the rich East to boot.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBe not offended:\r\nI speak not as in absolute fear of you.\r\nI think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\r\nIt weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash\r\nIs added to her wounds. I think, withal,\r\nThere would be hands uplifted in my right;\r\nAnd here, from gracious England, have I offer\r\nOf goodly thousands: but, for all this,\r\nWhen I shall tread upon the tyrant\u2019s head,\r\nOr wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\r\nShall have more vices than it had before,\r\nMore suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,\r\nBy him that shall succeed.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nWhat should he be?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nIt is myself I mean; in whom I know\r\nAll the particulars of vice so grafted\r\nThat, when they shall be open\u2019d, black Macbeth\r\nWill seem as pure as snow; and the poor state\r\nEsteem him as a lamb, being compar\u2019d\r\nWith my confineless harms.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nNot in the legions\r\nOf horrid hell can come a devil more damn\u2019d\r\nIn evils to top Macbeth.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nI grant him bloody,\r\nLuxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\r\nSudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\r\nThat has a name: but there\u2019s no bottom, none,\r\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\r\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill up\r\nThe cistern of my lust; and my desire\r\nAll continent impediments would o\u2019erbear,\r\nThat did oppose my will: better Macbeth\r\nThan such an one to reign.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nBoundless intemperance\r\nIn nature is a tyranny; it hath been\r\nTh\u2019 untimely emptying of the happy throne,\r\nAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yet\r\nTo take upon you what is yours: you may\r\nConvey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\r\nAnd yet seem cold\u2014the time you may so hoodwink.\r\nWe have willing dames enough; there cannot be\r\nThat vulture in you, to devour so many\r\nAs will to greatness dedicate themselves,\r\nFinding it so inclin\u2019d.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nWith this there grows\r\nIn my most ill-compos\u2019d affection such\r\nA staunchless avarice, that, were I king,\r\nI should cut off the nobles for their lands;\r\nDesire his jewels, and this other\u2019s house:\r\nAnd my more-having would be as a sauce\r\nTo make me hunger more; that I should forge\r\nQuarrels unjust against the good and loyal,\r\nDestroying them for wealth.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nThis avarice\r\nSticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root\r\nThan summer-seeming lust; and it hath been\r\nThe sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;\r\nScotland hath foisons to fill up your will,\r\nOf your mere own. All these are portable,\r\nWith other graces weigh\u2019d.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBut I have none: the king-becoming graces,\r\nAs justice, verity, temp\u2019rance, stableness,\r\nBounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,\r\nDevotion, patience, courage, fortitude,\r\nI have no relish of them; but abound\r\nIn the division of each several crime,\r\nActing it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should\r\nPour the sweet milk of concord into hell,\r\nUproar the universal peace, confound\r\nAll unity on earth.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nO Scotland, Scotland!\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nIf such a one be fit to govern, speak:\r\nI am as I have spoken.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nFit to govern?\r\nNo, not to live.\u2014O nation miserable,\r\nWith an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter\u2019d,\r\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,\r\nSince that the truest issue of thy throne\r\nBy his own interdiction stands accus\u2019d,\r\nAnd does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father\r\nWas a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,\r\nOft\u2019ner upon her knees than on her feet,\r\nDied every day she lived. Fare thee well!\r\nThese evils thou repeat\u2019st upon thyself\r\nHave banish\u2019d me from Scotland.\u2014O my breast,\r\nThy hope ends here!\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nMacduff, this noble passion,\r\nChild of integrity, hath from my soul\r\nWiped the black scruples, reconcil\u2019d my thoughts\r\nTo thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth\r\nBy many of these trains hath sought to win me\r\nInto his power, and modest wisdom plucks me\r\nFrom over-credulous haste: but God above\r\nDeal between thee and me! for even now\r\nI put myself to thy direction, and\r\nUnspeak mine own detraction; here abjure\r\nThe taints and blames I laid upon myself,\r\nFor strangers to my nature. I am yet\r\nUnknown to woman; never was forsworn;\r\nScarcely have coveted what was mine own;\r\nAt no time broke my faith; would not betray\r\nThe devil to his fellow; and delight\r\nNo less in truth than life: my first false speaking\r\nWas this upon myself. What I am truly,\r\nIs thine and my poor country\u2019s to command:\r\nWhither, indeed, before thy here-approach,\r\nOld Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,\r\nAlready at a point, was setting forth.\r\nNow we\u2019ll together, and the chance of goodness\r\nBe like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nSuch welcome and unwelcome things at once\r\n\u2019Tis hard to reconcile.\r\n\r\n Enter a Doctor.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nWell; more anon.\u2014Comes the King forth, I pray you?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nAy, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls\r\nThat stay his cure: their malady convinces\r\nThe great assay of art; but at his touch,\r\nSuch sanctity hath heaven given his hand,\r\nThey presently amend.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nI thank you, doctor.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Doctor._]\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nWhat\u2019s the disease he means?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\n\u2019Tis call\u2019d the evil:\r\nA most miraculous work in this good king;\r\nWhich often, since my here-remain in England,\r\nI have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,\r\nHimself best knows, but strangely-visited people,\r\nAll swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,\r\nThe mere despair of surgery, he cures;\r\nHanging a golden stamp about their necks,\r\nPut on with holy prayers: and \u2019tis spoken,\r\nTo the succeeding royalty he leaves\r\nThe healing benediction. With this strange virtue,\r\nHe hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;\r\nAnd sundry blessings hang about his throne,\r\nThat speak him full of grace.\r\n\r\n Enter Ross.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nSee, who comes here?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nMy countryman; but yet I know him not.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nMy ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nI know him now. Good God, betimes remove\r\nThe means that makes us strangers!\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nSir, amen.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nStands Scotland where it did?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nAlas, poor country,\r\nAlmost afraid to know itself! It cannot\r\nBe call\u2019d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,\r\nBut who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\r\nWhere sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,\r\nAre made, not mark\u2019d; where violent sorrow seems\r\nA modern ecstasy. The dead man\u2019s knell\r\nIs there scarce ask\u2019d for who; and good men\u2019s lives\r\nExpire before the flowers in their caps,\r\nDying or ere they sicken.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nO, relation\r\nToo nice, and yet too true!\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nWhat\u2019s the newest grief?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nThat of an hour\u2019s age doth hiss the speaker;\r\nEach minute teems a new one.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nHow does my wife?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWhy, well.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nAnd all my children?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWell too.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nThe tyrant has not batter\u2019d at their peace?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nNo; they were well at peace when I did leave \u2019em.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nBe not a niggard of your speech: how goes\u2019t?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWhen I came hither to transport the tidings,\r\nWhich I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour\r\nOf many worthy fellows that were out;\r\nWhich was to my belief witness\u2019d the rather,\r\nFor that I saw the tyrant\u2019s power afoot.\r\nNow is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland\r\nWould create soldiers, make our women fight,\r\nTo doff their dire distresses.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBe\u2019t their comfort\r\nWe are coming thither. Gracious England hath\r\nLent us good Siward and ten thousand men;\r\nAn older and a better soldier none\r\nThat Christendom gives out.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWould I could answer\r\nThis comfort with the like! But I have words\r\nThat would be howl\u2019d out in the desert air,\r\nWhere hearing should not latch them.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nWhat concern they?\r\nThe general cause? or is it a fee-grief\r\nDue to some single breast?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nNo mind that\u2019s honest\r\nBut in it shares some woe, though the main part\r\nPertains to you alone.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nIf it be mine,\r\nKeep it not from me, quickly let me have it.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nLet not your ears despise my tongue for ever,\r\nWhich shall possess them with the heaviest sound\r\nThat ever yet they heard.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nHumh! I guess at it.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nYour castle is surpris\u2019d; your wife and babes\r\nSavagely slaughter\u2019d. To relate the manner\r\nWere, on the quarry of these murder\u2019d deer,\r\nTo add the death of you.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nMerciful heaven!\u2014\r\nWhat, man! ne\u2019er pull your hat upon your brows.\r\nGive sorrow words. The grief that does not speak\r\nWhispers the o\u2019er-fraught heart, and bids it break.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nMy children too?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWife, children, servants, all\r\nThat could be found.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nAnd I must be from thence!\r\nMy wife kill\u2019d too?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nI have said.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBe comforted:\r\nLet\u2019s make us med\u2019cines of our great revenge,\r\nTo cure this deadly grief.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nHe has no children.\u2014All my pretty ones?\r\nDid you say all?\u2014O hell-kite!\u2014All?\r\nWhat, all my pretty chickens and their dam\r\nAt one fell swoop?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nDispute it like a man.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI shall do so;\r\nBut I must also feel it as a man:\r\nI cannot but remember such things were,\r\nThat were most precious to me.\u2014Did heaven look on,\r\nAnd would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,\r\nThey were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,\r\nNot for their own demerits, but for mine,\r\nFell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBe this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief\r\nConvert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes,\r\nAnd braggart with my tongue!\u2014But, gentle heavens,\r\nCut short all intermission; front to front,\r\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\r\nWithin my sword\u2019s length set him; if he \u2019scape,\r\nHeaven forgive him too!\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nThis tune goes manly.\r\nCome, go we to the King. Our power is ready;\r\nOur lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth\r\nIs ripe for shaking, and the powers above\r\nPut on their instruments.

A Room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nI have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your\r\nreport. When was it she last walked?\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nSince his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her\r\nbed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,\r\nfold it, write upon\u2019t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to\r\nbed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nA great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of\r\nsleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation,\r\nbesides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time,\r\nhave you heard her say?\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nThat, sir, which I will not report after her.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nYou may to me; and \u2019tis most meet you should.\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nNeither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.\r\n\r\n Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.\r\n\r\nLo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast\r\nasleep. Observe her; stand close.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nHow came she by that light?\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nWhy, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; \u2019tis her\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nYou see, her eyes are open.\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nAy, but their sense are shut.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nWhat is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nIt is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I\r\nhave known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nYet here\u2019s a spot.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nHark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my\r\nremembrance the more strongly.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nOut, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then \u2019tis time to do\u2019t.\r\nHell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we\r\nfear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who\r\nwould have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nDo you mark that?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nThe Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?\u2014What, will these hands\r\nne\u2019er be clean? No more o\u2019 that, my lord, no more o\u2019 that: you mar all\r\nwith this starting.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nGo to, go to.
