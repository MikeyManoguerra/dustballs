She lingers my desires,\nLike to a step-dame or a dowager,\nLong withering out a young man\u2019s revenue.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nFour days will quickly steep themselves in night;\nFour nights will quickly dream away the time;\nAnd then the moon, like to a silver bow\nNew bent in heaven, shall behold the night\nOf our solemnities.\n\nTHESEUS.\nGo, Philostrate,\nStir up the Athenian youth to merriments;\nAwake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;\nTurn melancholy forth to funerals;\nThe pale companion is not for our pomp.\n\n [_Exit Philostrate._]\n\nHippolyta, I woo\u2019d thee with my sword,\nAnd won thy love doing thee injuries;\nBut I will wed thee in another key,\nWith pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.\n\n Enter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius.\n\nEGEUS.\nHappy be Theseus, our renown\u00e8d Duke!\n\nTHESEUS.\nThanks, good Egeus. What\u2019s the news with thee?\n\nEGEUS.\nFull of vexation come I, with complaint\nAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia.\nStand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,\nThis man hath my consent to marry her.\nStand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,\nThis man hath bewitch\u2019d the bosom of my child.\nThou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,\nAnd interchang\u2019d love-tokens with my child.\nThou hast by moonlight at her window sung,\nWith feigning voice, verses of feigning love;\nAnd stol\u2019n the impression of her fantasy\nWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,\nKnacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers\nOf strong prevailment in unharden\u2019d youth)\nWith cunning hast thou filch\u2019d my daughter\u2019s heart,\nTurn\u2019d her obedience (which is due to me)\nTo stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,\nBe it so she will not here before your grace\nConsent to marry with Demetrius,\nI beg the ancient privilege of Athens:\nAs she is mine I may dispose of her;\nWhich shall be either to this gentleman\nOr to her death, according to our law\nImmediately provided in that case.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWhat say you, Hermia? Be advis\u2019d, fair maid.\nTo you your father should be as a god;\nOne that compos\u2019d your beauties, yea, and one\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\nTo leave the figure, or disfigure it.\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\n\nHERMIA.\nSo is Lysander.\n\nTHESEUS.\nIn himself he is.\nBut in this kind, wanting your father\u2019s voice,\nThe other must be held the worthier.\n\nHERMIA.\nI would my father look\u2019d but with my eyes.\n\nTHESEUS.\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\n\nHERMIA.\nI do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\nNor how it may concern my modesty\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts:\nBut I beseech your Grace that I may know\nThe worst that may befall me in this case,\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\n\nTHESEUS.\nEither to die the death, or to abjure\nFor ever the society of men.\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\nWhether, if you yield not to your father\u2019s choice,\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mew\u2019d,\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\nChanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.\nThrice-bless\u00e8d they that master so their blood\nTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage,\nBut earthlier happy is the rose distill\u2019d\nThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\nGrows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.\n\nHERMIA.\nSo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,\nEre I will yield my virgin patent up\nUnto his lordship, whose unwish\u00e8d yoke\nMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.\n\nTHESEUS.\nTake time to pause; and by the next new moon\nThe sealing-day betwixt my love and me\nFor everlasting bond of fellowship,\nUpon that day either prepare to die\nFor disobedience to your father\u2019s will,\nOr else to wed Demetrius, as he would,\nOr on Diana\u2019s altar to protest\nFor aye austerity and single life.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nRelent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield\nThy craz\u00e8d title to my certain right.\n\nLYSANDER.\nYou have her father\u2019s love, Demetrius.\nLet me have Hermia\u2019s. Do you marry him.\n\nEGEUS.\nScornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;\nAnd what is mine my love shall render him;\nAnd she is mine, and all my right of her\nI do estate unto Demetrius.\n\nLYSANDER.\nI am, my lord, as well deriv\u2019d as he,\nAs well possess\u2019d; my love is more than his;\nMy fortunes every way as fairly rank\u2019d,\nIf not with vantage, as Demetrius\u2019;\nAnd, which is more than all these boasts can be,\nI am belov\u2019d of beauteous Hermia.\nWhy should not I then prosecute my right?\nDemetrius, I\u2019ll avouch it to his head,\nMade love to Nedar\u2019s daughter, Helena,\nAnd won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,\nDevoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,\nUpon this spotted and inconstant man.\n\nTHESEUS.\nI must confess that I have heard so much,\nAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;\nBut, being over-full of self-affairs,\nMy mind did lose it.\u2014But, Demetrius, come,\nAnd come, Egeus; you shall go with me.\nI have some private schooling for you both.\u2014\nFor you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\nTo fit your fancies to your father\u2019s will,\nOr else the law of Athens yields you up\n(Which by no means we may extenuate)\nTo death, or to a vow of single life.\nCome, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?\nDemetrius and Egeus, go along;\nI must employ you in some business\nAgainst our nuptial, and confer with you\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\n\nEGEUS.\nWith duty and desire we follow you.\n\n [_Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia._]\n\nLYSANDER.\nHow now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?\nHow chance the roses there do fade so fast?\n\nHERMIA.\nBelike for want of rain, which I could well\nBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.\n\nLYSANDER.\nAy me! For aught that I could ever read,\nCould ever hear by tale or history,\nThe course of true love never did run smooth.\nBut either it was different in blood\u2014\n\nHERMIA.\nO cross! Too high to be enthrall\u2019d to low.\n\nLYSANDER.\nOr else misgraff\u00e8d in respect of years\u2014\n\nHERMIA.\nO spite! Too old to be engag\u2019d to young.\n\nLYSANDER.\nOr else it stood upon the choice of friends\u2014\n\nHERMIA.\nO hell! to choose love by another\u2019s eyes!\n\nLYSANDER.\nOr, if there were a sympathy in choice,\nWar, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,\nMaking it momentany as a sound,\nSwift as a shadow, short as any dream,\nBrief as the lightning in the collied night\nThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,\nAnd, ere a man hath power to say, \u2018Behold!\u2019\nThe jaws of darkness do devour it up:\nSo quick bright things come to confusion.\n\nHERMIA.\nIf then true lovers have ever cross\u2019d,\nIt stands as an edict in destiny.\nThen let us teach our trial patience,\nBecause it is a customary cross,\nAs due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,\nWishes and tears, poor fancy\u2019s followers.\n\nLYSANDER.\nA good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.\nI have a widow aunt, a dowager\nOf great revenue, and she hath no child.\nFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues,\nAnd she respects me as her only son.\nThere, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,\nAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law\nCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,\nSteal forth thy father\u2019s house tomorrow night;\nAnd in the wood, a league without the town\n(Where I did meet thee once with Helena\nTo do observance to a morn of May),\nThere will I stay for thee.\n\nHERMIA.\nMy good Lysander!\nI swear to thee by Cupid\u2019s strongest bow,\nBy his best arrow with the golden head,\nBy the simplicity of Venus\u2019 doves,\nBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\nAnd by that fire which burn\u2019d the Carthage queen\nWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,\nBy all the vows that ever men have broke\n(In number more than ever women spoke),\nIn that same place thou hast appointed me,\nTomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\n\nLYSANDER.\nKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\n\n Enter Helena.\n\nHERMIA.\nGod speed fair Helena! Whither away?\n\nHELENA.\nCall you me fair? That fair again unsay.\nDemetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!\nYour eyes are lode-stars and your tongue\u2019s sweet air\nMore tuneable than lark to shepherd\u2019s ear,\nWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\nSickness is catching. O were favour so,\nYours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,\nMy tongue should catch your tongue\u2019s sweet melody.\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\nThe rest I\u2019d give to be to you translated.\nO, teach me how you look, and with what art\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius\u2019 heart!\n\nHERMIA.\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\n\nHELENA.\nO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!\n\nHERMIA.\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\n\nHELENA.\nO that my prayers could such affection move!\n\nHERMIA.\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\n\nHELENA.\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\n\nHERMIA.\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\n\nHELENA.\nNone but your beauty; would that fault were mine!\n\nHERMIA.\nTake comfort: he no more shall see my face;\nLysander and myself will fly this place.\nBefore the time I did Lysander see,\nSeem\u2019d Athens as a paradise to me.\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell,\nThat he hath turn\u2019d a heaven into hell!\n\nLYSANDER.\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold:\nTomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold\nHer silver visage in the watery glass,\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass\n(A time that lovers\u2019 flights doth still conceal),\nThrough Athens\u2019 gates have we devis\u2019d to steal.\n\nHERMIA.\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet,\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes,\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\nFarewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!\nKeep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight\nFrom lovers\u2019 food, till morrow deep midnight.\n\nLYSANDER.\nI will, my Hermia.\n\n [_Exit Hermia._]\n\nHelena, adieu.\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\n\n [_Exit Lysander._]\n\nHELENA.\nHow happy some o\u2019er other some can be!\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\nAnd as he errs, doting on Hermia\u2019s eyes,\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;\nAnd therefore is wing\u2019d Cupid painted blind.\nNor hath love\u2019s mind of any judgment taste.\nWings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.\nAnd therefore is love said to be a child,\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguil\u2019d.\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\nSo the boy Love is perjur\u2019d everywhere.\nFor, ere Demetrius look\u2019d on Hermia\u2019s eyne,\nHe hail\u2019d down oaths that he was only mine;\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\nSo he dissolv\u2019d, and showers of oaths did melt.\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia\u2019s flight.\nThen to the wood will he tomorrow night\nPursue her; and for this intelligence\nIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\n\n [_Exit Helena._]\n\n\nSCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage\n\n Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout  and Starveling.\n\nQUINCE.\nIs all our company here?\n\nBOTTOM.\nYou were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the\nscrip.\n\nQUINCE.\nHere is the scroll of every man\u2019s name, which is thought fit through\nall Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and Duchess, on\nhis wedding-day at night.\n\nBOTTOM.\nFirst, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the\nnames of the actors; and so grow to a point.\n\nQUINCE.\nMarry, our play is _The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of\nPyramus and Thisbe_.\n\nBOTTOM.\nA very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter\nQuince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread\nyourselves.\n\nQUINCE.\nAnswer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.\n\nBOTTOM.\nReady. Name what part I am for, and proceed.\n\nQUINCE.\nYou, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWhat is Pyramus\u2014a lover, or a tyrant?\n\nQUINCE.\nA lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.\n\nBOTTOM.\nThat will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let\nthe audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in\nsome measure. To the rest\u2014yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could\nplay Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.\n\n    The raging rocks\n    And shivering shocks\n    Shall break the locks\n           Of prison gates,\n    And Phibbus\u2019 car\n    Shall shine from far,\n    And make and mar\n           The foolish Fates.\n\nThis was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles\u2019 vein,\na tyrant\u2019s vein; a lover is more condoling.\n\nQUINCE.\nFrancis Flute, the bellows-mender.\n\nFLUTE.\nHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE.\nFlute, you must take Thisbe on you.\n\nFLUTE.\nWhat is Thisbe? A wandering knight?\n\nQUINCE.\nIt is the lady that Pyramus must love.\n\nFLUTE.\nNay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming.\n\nQUINCE.\nThat\u2019s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small\nas you will.\n\nBOTTOM.\nAnd I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I\u2019ll speak in a\nmonstrous little voice; \u2018Thisne, Thisne!\u2019\u2014\u2018Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear!\nthy Thisbe dear! and lady dear!\u2019\n\nQUINCE.\nNo, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisbe.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWell, proceed.\n\nQUINCE.\nRobin Starveling, the tailor.\n\nSTARVELING.\nHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE.\nRobin Starveling, you must play Thisbe\u2019s mother.\nTom Snout, the tinker.\n\nSNOUT\nHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE.\nYou, Pyramus\u2019 father; myself, Thisbe\u2019s father;\nSnug, the joiner, you, the lion\u2019s part. And, I hope here is a play\nfitted.\n\nSNUG\nHave you the lion\u2019s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I\nam slow of study.\n\nQUINCE.\nYou may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.\n\nBOTTOM.\nLet me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man\u2019s heart\ngood to hear me. I will roar that I will make the Duke say \u2018Let him\nroar again, let him roar again.\u2019\n\nQUINCE.\nIf you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the\nladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.\n\nALL\nThat would hang us every mother\u2019s son.\n\nBOTTOM.\nI grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their\nwits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us. But I will\naggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking\ndove; I will roar you an \u2019twere any nightingale.\n\nQUINCE.\nYou can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a\nproper man as one shall see in a summer\u2019s day; a most lovely\ngentleman-like man. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWell, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?\n\nQUINCE.\nWhy, what you will.\n\nBOTTOM.\nI will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your\norange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your\nFrench-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.\n\nQUINCE.\nSome of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play\nbare-faced. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you,\nrequest you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me\nin the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will\nwe rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg\u2019d with\ncompany, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of\nproperties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWe will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and\ncourageously. Take pains, be perfect; adieu.\n\nQUINCE.\nAt the Duke\u2019s oak we meet.\n\nBOTTOM.\nEnough. Hold, or cut bow-strings.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT II\n\nSCENE I. A wood near Athens\n\n Enter a Fairy at one door, and Puck at another.\n\nPUCK.\nHow now, spirit! Whither wander you?\n\nFAIRY\n    Over hill, over dale,\n        Thorough bush, thorough brier,\n    Over park, over pale,\n        Thorough flood, thorough fire,\n    I do wander everywhere,\n    Swifter than the moon\u2019s sphere;\n    And I serve the Fairy Queen,\n    To dew her orbs upon the green.\n    The cowslips tall her pensioners be,\n    In their gold coats spots you see;\n    Those be rubies, fairy favours,\n    In those freckles live their savours.\nI must go seek some dew-drops here,\nAnd hang a pearl in every cowslip\u2019s ear.\nFarewell, thou lob of spirits; I\u2019ll be gone.\nOur Queen and all her elves come here anon.\n\nPUCK.\nThe King doth keep his revels here tonight;\nTake heed the Queen come not within his sight,\nFor Oberon is passing fell and wrath,\nBecause that she, as her attendant, hath\nA lovely boy, stol\u2019n from an Indian king;\nShe never had so sweet a changeling.\nAnd jealous Oberon would have the child\nKnight of his train, to trace the forests wild:\nBut she perforce withholds the lov\u00e8d boy,\nCrowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.\nAnd now they never meet in grove or green,\nBy fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,\nBut they do square; that all their elves for fear\nCreep into acorn cups, and hide them there.\n\nFAIRY\nEither I mistake your shape and making quite,\nOr else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite\nCall\u2019d Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he\nThat frights the maidens of the villagery,\nSkim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,\nAnd bootless make the breathless housewife churn,\nAnd sometime make the drink to bear no barm,\nMislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?\nThose that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,\nYou do their work, and they shall have good luck.\nAre not you he?\n\nPUCK.\nThou speak\u2019st aright;\nI am that merry wanderer of the night.\nI jest to Oberon, and make him smile,\nWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,\nNeighing in likeness of a filly foal;\nAnd sometime lurk I in a gossip\u2019s bowl\nIn very likeness of a roasted crab,\nAnd, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,\nAnd on her withered dewlap pour the ale.\nThe wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,\nSometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;\nThen slip I from her bum, down topples she,\nAnd \u2018tailor\u2019 cries, and falls into a cough;\nAnd then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe\nAnd waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear\nA merrier hour was never wasted there.\nBut room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.\n\nFAIRY\nAnd here my mistress. Would that he were gone!\n\n Enter Oberon at one door, with his Train, and Titania at another, with\n hers.\n\nOBERON.\nIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.\n\nTITANIA.\nWhat, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;\nI have forsworn his bed and company.\n\nOBERON.\nTarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?\n\nTITANIA.\nThen I must be thy lady; but I know\nWhen thou hast stol\u2019n away from fairyland,\nAnd in the shape of Corin sat all day\nPlaying on pipes of corn, and versing love\nTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\nCome from the farthest steep of India,\nBut that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\nYour buskin\u2019d mistress and your warrior love,\nTo Theseus must be wedded; and you come\nTo give their bed joy and prosperity?\n\nOBERON.\nHow canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering night\nFrom Perigenia, whom he ravished?\nAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith,\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\n\nTITANIA.\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy:\nAnd never, since the middle summer\u2019s spring,\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\nBy pav\u00e8d fountain, or by rushy brook,\nOr on the beach\u00e8d margent of the sea,\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\nBut with thy brawls thou hast disturb\u2019d our sport.\nTherefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\nAs in revenge, have suck\u2019d up from the sea\nContagious fogs; which, falling in the land,\nHath every pelting river made so proud\nThat they have overborne their continents.\nThe ox hath therefore stretch\u2019d his yoke in vain,\nThe ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn\nHath rotted ere his youth attain\u2019d a beard.\nThe fold stands empty in the drown\u00e8d field,\nAnd crows are fatted with the murrion flock;\nThe nine-men\u2019s-morris is fill\u2019d up with mud,\nAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\nFor lack of tread, are undistinguishable.\nThe human mortals want their winter here.\nNo night is now with hymn or carol blest.\nTherefore the moon, the governess of floods,\nPale in her anger, washes all the air,\nThat rheumatic diseases do abound.\nAnd thorough this distemperature we see\nThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\nFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;\nAnd on old Hiems\u2019 thin and icy crown\nAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\nIs, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,\nThe childing autumn, angry winter, change\nTheir wonted liveries; and the mazed world,\nBy their increase, now knows not which is which.\nAnd this same progeny of evils comes\nFrom our debate, from our dissension;\nWe are their parents and original.\n\nOBERON.\nDo you amend it, then. It lies in you.\nWhy should Titania cross her Oberon?\nI do but beg a little changeling boy\nTo be my henchman.\n\nTITANIA.\nSet your heart at rest;\nThe fairyland buys not the child of me.\nHis mother was a vot\u2019ress of my order,\nAnd in the spic\u00e8d Indian air, by night,\nFull often hath she gossip\u2019d by my side;\nAnd sat with me on Neptune\u2019s yellow sands,\nMarking th\u2019 embark\u00e8d traders on the flood,\nWhen we have laugh\u2019d to see the sails conceive,\nAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\nWhich she, with pretty and with swimming gait\nFollowing (her womb then rich with my young squire),\nWould imitate, and sail upon the land,\nTo fetch me trifles, and return again,\nAs from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\nBut she, being mortal, of that boy did die;\nAnd for her sake do I rear up her boy,\nAnd for her sake I will not part with him.\n\nOBERON.\nHow long within this wood intend you stay?\n\nTITANIA.\nPerchance till after Theseus\u2019 wedding-day.\nIf you will patiently dance in our round,\nAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us;\nIf not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\n\nOBERON.\nGive me that boy and I will go with thee.\n\nTITANIA.\nNot for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.\nWe shall chide downright if I longer stay.\n\n [_Exit Titania with her Train._]\n\nOBERON.\nWell, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove\nTill I torment thee for this injury.\u2014\nMy gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb\u2019rest\nSince once I sat upon a promontory,\nAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin\u2019s back\nUttering such dulcet and harmonious breath\nThat the rude sea grew civil at her song\nAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheres\nTo hear the sea-maid\u2019s music.\n\nPUCK.\nI remember.\n\nOBERON.\nThat very time I saw, (but thou couldst not),\nFlying between the cold moon and the earth,\nCupid all arm\u2019d: a certain aim he took\nAt a fair vestal, thron\u00e8d by the west,\nAnd loos\u2019d his love-shaft smartly from his bow\nAs it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.\nBut I might see young Cupid\u2019s fiery shaft\nQuench\u2019d in the chaste beams of the watery moon;\nAnd the imperial votress passed on,\nIn maiden meditation, fancy-free.\nYet mark\u2019d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:\nIt fell upon a little western flower,\nBefore milk-white, now purple with love\u2019s wound,\nAnd maidens call it love-in-idleness.\nFetch me that flower, the herb I showed thee once:\nThe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid\nWill make or man or woman madly dote\nUpon the next live creature that it sees.\nFetch me this herb, and be thou here again\nEre the leviathan can swim a league.\n\nPUCK.\nI\u2019ll put a girdle round about the earth\nIn forty minutes.\n\n [_Exit Puck._]\n\nOBERON.\nHaving once this juice,\nI\u2019ll watch Titania when she is asleep,\nAnd drop the liquor of it in her eyes:\nThe next thing then she waking looks upon\n(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,\nOn meddling monkey, or on busy ape)\nShe shall pursue it with the soul of love.\nAnd ere I take this charm from off her sight\n(As I can take it with another herb)\nI\u2019ll make her render up her page to me.\nBut who comes here?

Bootless speed,\nWhen cowardice pursues and valour flies!\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nI will not stay thy questions. Let me go,\nOr if thou follow me, do not believe\nBut I shall do thee mischief in the wood.\n\nHELENA.\nAy, in the temple, in the town, the field,\nYou do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!\nYour wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.\nWe cannot fight for love as men may do.\nWe should be woo\u2019d, and were not made to woo.\n\n [_Exit Demetrius._]\n\nI\u2019ll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,\nTo die upon the hand I love so well.\n\n [_Exit Helena._]\n\nOBERON.\nFare thee well, nymph.

The Wood.\n\n The Queen of Fairies still lying asleep.\n\n Enter Bottom, Quince, Snout, Starveling, Snug and Flute.\n\nBOTTOM.\nAre we all met?\n\nQUINCE.\nPat, pat; and here\u2019s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal.\nThis green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our\ntiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will do it before the\nDuke.\n\nBOTTOM.\nPeter Quince?\n\nQUINCE.\nWhat sayest thou, bully Bottom?\n\nBOTTOM.\nThere are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never\nplease. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the\nladies cannot abide. How answer you that?\n\nSNOUT\nBy\u2019r lakin, a parlous fear.\n\nSTARVELING.\nI believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.\n\nBOTTOM.\nNot a whit; I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and\nlet the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and\nthat Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for the more better assurance,\ntell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver. This\nwill put them out of fear.\n\nQUINCE.\nWell, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written in eight\nand six.\n\nBOTTOM.\nNo, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.\n\nSNOUT\nWill not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\n\nSTARVELING.\nI fear it, I promise you.\n\nBOTTOM.\nMasters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield\nus!) a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing. For there is not a\nmore fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to\nit.\n\nSNOUT\nTherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.\n\nBOTTOM.\nNay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the\nlion\u2019s neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the\nsame defect: \u2018Ladies,\u2019 or, \u2018Fair ladies, I would wish you,\u2019 or, \u2018I\nwould request you,\u2019 or, \u2019I would entreat you, not to fear, not to\ntremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it\nwere pity of my life. No, I am no such thing; I am a man as other men\nare\u2019: and there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly\nhe is Snug the joiner.\n\nQUINCE.\nWell, it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring\nthe moonlight into a chamber, for you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by\nmoonlight.\n\nSNOUT\nDoth the moon shine that night we play our play?\n\nBOTTOM.\nA calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out moonshine, find\nout moonshine.\n\nQUINCE.\nYes, it doth shine that night.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWhy, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where\nwe play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.\n\nQUINCE.\nAy; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and\nsay he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine. Then\nthere is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for\nPyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a\nwall.\n\nSNOUT\nYou can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?\n\nBOTTOM.\nSome man or other must present Wall. And let him have some plaster, or\nsome loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him\nhold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe\nwhisper.\n\nQUINCE.\nIf that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother\u2019s son,\nand rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your\nspeech, enter into that brake; and so everyone according to his cue.\n\n Enter Puck behind.\n\nPUCK.\nWhat hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,\nSo near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?\nWhat, a play toward? I\u2019ll be an auditor;\nAn actor too perhaps, if I see cause.\n\nQUINCE.\nSpeak, Pyramus.\u2014Thisbe, stand forth.\n\nPYRAMUS.\n_Thisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet_\n\nQUINCE.\nOdours, odours.\n\nPYRAMUS.\n_. . . odours savours sweet.\nSo hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.\nBut hark, a voice!

I\u2019ll lead you about a round,\n   Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier;\nSometime a horse I\u2019ll be, sometime a hound,\n   A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;\nAnd neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,\nLike horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nBOTTOM.\nWhy do they run away?

This is to make an ass of me, to fright me, if\nthey could. But I will not stir from this place, do what they can.

And yet, to\nsay the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays.\nThe more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them\nfriends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.\n\nTITANIA.\nThou art as wise as thou art beautiful.\n\nBOTTOM.\nNot so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I\nhave enough to serve mine own turn.\n\nTITANIA.\nOut of this wood do not desire to go.\nThou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.\nI am a spirit of no common rate.\nThe summer still doth tend upon my state;\nAnd I do love thee: therefore, go with me.\nI\u2019ll give thee fairies to attend on thee;\nAnd they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,\nAnd sing, while thou on press\u00e8d flowers dost sleep.\nAnd I will purge thy mortal grossness so\nThat thou shalt like an airy spirit go.\u2014\nPeaseblossom!

Seest thou this sweet sight?\nHer dotage now I do begin to pity.\nFor, meeting her of late behind the wood,\nSeeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,\nI did upbraid her and fall out with her:\nFor she his hairy temples then had rounded\nWith coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;\nAnd that same dew, which sometime on the buds\nWas wont to swell like round and orient pearls,\nStood now within the pretty flouriets\u2019 eyes,\nLike tears that did their own disgrace bewail.\nWhen I had at my pleasure taunted her,\nAnd she in mild terms begg\u2019d my patience,\nI then did ask of her her changeling child;\nWhich straight she gave me, and her fairy sent\nTo bear him to my bower in fairyland.\nAnd now I have the boy, I will undo\nThis hateful imperfection of her eyes.\nAnd, gentle Puck, take this transform\u00e8d scalp\nFrom off the head of this Athenian swain,\nThat he awaking when the other do,\nMay all to Athens back again repair,\nAnd think no more of this night\u2019s accidents\nBut as the fierce vexation of a dream.\nBut first I will release the Fairy Queen.\n\n [_Touching her eyes with an herb._]\n\n    Be as thou wast wont to be;\n    See as thou was wont to see.\n    Dian\u2019s bud o\u2019er Cupid\u2019s flower\n    Hath such force and blessed power.\nNow, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.\n\nTITANIA.\nMy Oberon, what visions have I seen!\nMethought I was enamour\u2019d of an ass.\n\nOBERON.\nThere lies your love.\n\nTITANIA.\nHow came these things to pass?\nO, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!\n\nOBERON.\nSilence awhile.\u2014Robin, take off this head.\nTitania, music call; and strike more dead\nThan common sleep, of all these five the sense.\n\nTITANIA.\nMusic, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep.\n\nPUCK.\nNow when thou wak\u2019st, with thine own fool\u2019s eyes peep.\n\nOBERON.\nSound, music.\n\n [_Still mucic._]\n\nCome, my queen, take hands with me,\nAnd rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.\nNow thou and I are new in amity,\nAnd will tomorrow midnight solemnly\nDance in Duke Theseus\u2019 house triumphantly,\nAnd bless it to all fair prosperity:\nThere shall the pairs of faithful lovers be\nWedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.\n\nPUCK.\n    Fairy king, attend and mark.\n    I do hear the morning lark.\n\nOBERON.\n    Then, my queen, in silence sad,\n    Trip we after night\u2019s shade.\n    We the globe can compass soon,\n    Swifter than the wand\u2019ring moon.\n\nTITANIA.\n    Come, my lord, and in our flight,\n    Tell me how it came this night\n    That I sleeping here was found\n    With these mortals on the ground.\n\n [_Exeunt.

Never did I hear\nSuch gallant chiding; for, besides the groves,\nThe skies, the fountains, every region near\nSeem\u2019d all one mutual cry. I never heard\nSo musical a discord, such sweet thunder.\n\nTHESEUS.\nMy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,\nSo flew\u2019d, so sanded; and their heads are hung\nWith ears that sweep away the morning dew;\nCrook-knee\u2019d and dewlap\u2019d like Thessalian bulls;\nSlow in pursuit, but match\u2019d in mouth like bells,\nEach under each. A cry more tuneable\nWas never holla\u2019d to, nor cheer\u2019d with horn,\nIn Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.\nJudge when you hear.\u2014But, soft, what nymphs are these?\n\nEGEUS.\nMy lord, this is my daughter here asleep,\nAnd this Lysander; this Demetrius is;\nThis Helena, old Nedar\u2019s Helena:\nI wonder of their being here together.\n\nTHESEUS.\nNo doubt they rose up early to observe\nThe rite of May; and, hearing our intent,\nCame here in grace of our solemnity.\nBut speak, Egeus; is not this the day\nThat Hermia should give answer of her choice?\n\nEGEUS.\nIt is, my lord.\n\nTHESEUS.\nGo, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.\n\n Horns, and shout within.

Our intent\nWas to be gone from Athens, where we might be,\nWithout the peril of the Athenian law.\n\nEGEUS.\nEnough, enough, my lord; you have enough.\nI beg the law, the law upon his head.\nThey would have stol\u2019n away, they would, Demetrius,\nThereby to have defeated you and me:\nYou of your wife, and me of my consent,\nOf my consent that she should be your wife.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nMy lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,\nOf this their purpose hither to this wood;\nAnd I in fury hither follow\u2019d them,\nFair Helena in fancy following me.\nBut, my good lord, I wot not by what power,\n(But by some power it is) my love to Hermia,\nMelted as the snow, seems to me now\nAs the remembrance of an idle gaud\nWhich in my childhood I did dote upon;\nAnd all the faith, the virtue of my heart,\nThe object and the pleasure of mine eye,\nIs only Helena. To her, my lord,\nWas I betroth\u2019d ere I saw Hermia.\nBut like a sickness did I loathe this food.\nBut, as in health, come to my natural taste,\nNow I do wish it, love it, long for it,\nAnd will for evermore be true to it.\n\nTHESEUS.\nFair lovers, you are fortunately met.\nOf this discourse we more will hear anon.\nEgeus, I will overbear your will;\nFor in the temple, by and by with us,\nThese couples shall eternally be knit.\nAnd, for the morning now is something worn,\nOur purpos\u2019d hunting shall be set aside.\nAway with us to Athens. Three and three,\nWe\u2019ll hold a feast in great solemnity.\nCome, Hippolyta.\n\n [_Exeunt Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus and Train._]\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nThese things seem small and undistinguishable,\nLike far-off mountains turn\u00e8d into clouds.\n\nHERMIA.\nMethinks I see these things with parted eye,\nWhen everything seems double.\n\nHELENA.\nSo methinks.\nAnd I have found Demetrius like a jewel,\nMine own, and not mine own.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAre you sure\nThat we are awake? It seems to me\nThat yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think\nThe Duke was here, and bid us follow him?\n\nHERMIA.\nYea, and my father.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd Hippolyta.\n\nLYSANDER.\nAnd he did bid us follow to the temple.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nWhy, then, we are awake: let\u2019s follow him,\nAnd by the way let us recount our dreams.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nBOTTOM.\n[_Waking._] When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer.

I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit\nof man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to\nexpound this dream. Methought I was\u2014there is no man can tell what.\nMethought I was, and methought I had\u2014but man is but a patched fool if\nhe will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not\nheard, the ear of man hath not seen, man\u2019s hand is not able to taste,\nhis tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I\nwill get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be\ncalled \u2018Bottom\u2019s Dream\u2019, because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it\nin the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure, to make it\nthe more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\nSCENE II. Athens.

Out of doubt he is transported.\n\nFLUTE.\nIf he come not, then the play is marred. It goes not forward, doth it?\n\nQUINCE.\nIt is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge\nPyramus but he.\n\nFLUTE.\nNo, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.\n\nQUINCE.\nYea, and the best person too, and he is a very paramour for a sweet\nvoice.\n\n\nFLUTE.\nYou must say paragon. A paramour is, God bless us, a thing of naught.\n\n Enter Snug.\n\nSNUG\nMasters, the Duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three\nlords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had\nall been made men.\n\nFLUTE.\nO sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life;\nhe could not have \u2019scaped sixpence a day. An the Duke had not given him\nsixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I\u2019ll be hanged. He would have\ndeserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.\n\n Enter Bottom.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWhere are these lads? Where are these hearts?\n\nQUINCE.\nBottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!\n\nBOTTOM.\nMasters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not what; for if I tell\nyou, I am not true Athenian. I will tell you everything, right as it\nfell out.\n\nQUINCE.\nLet us hear, sweet Bottom.\n\nBOTTOM.\nNot a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the Duke hath\ndined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new\nribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look\no\u2019er his part. For the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In\nany case, let Thisbe have clean linen; and let not him that plays the\nlion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion\u2019s claws.

An Apartment in the Palace of Theseus\n\n Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate, Lords and Attendants.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\n\u2019Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.\n\nTHESEUS.\nMore strange than true. I never may believe\nThese antique fables, nor these fairy toys.\nLovers and madmen have such seething brains,\nSuch shaping fantasies, that apprehend\nMore than cool reason ever comprehends.\nThe lunatic, the lover, and the poet\nAre of imagination all compact:\nOne sees more devils than vast hell can hold;\nThat is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,\nSees Helen\u2019s beauty in a brow of Egypt:\nThe poet\u2019s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\nDoth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet\u2019s pen\nTurns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing\nA local habitation and a name.\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination,\nThat if it would but apprehend some joy,\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy.\nOr in the night, imagining some fear,\nHow easy is a bush supposed a bear?\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nBut all the story of the night told over,\nAnd all their minds transfigur\u2019d so together,\nMore witnesseth than fancy\u2019s images,\nAnd grows to something of great constancy;\nBut, howsoever, strange and admirable.\n\n Enter lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia and Helena.\n\nTHESEUS.\nHere come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.\nJoy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love\nAccompany your hearts!\n\nLYSANDER.\nMore than to us\nWait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!\n\nTHESEUS.\nCome now; what masques, what dances shall we have,\nTo wear away this long age of three hours\nBetween our after-supper and bed-time?\nWhere is our usual manager of mirth?\nWhat revels are in hand? Is there no play\nTo ease the anguish of a torturing hour?\nCall Philostrate.\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nHere, mighty Theseus.\n\nTHESEUS.\nSay, what abridgment have you for this evening?\nWhat masque? What music? How shall we beguile\nThe lazy time, if not with some delight?\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nThere is a brief how many sports are ripe.\nMake choice of which your Highness will see first.\n\n [_Giving a paper._]\n\nTHESEUS.\n[_Reads_] \u2018The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung\nBy an Athenian eunuch to the harp.\u2019\nWe\u2019ll none of that. That have I told my love\nIn glory of my kinsman Hercules.\n\u2018The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,\nTearing the Thracian singer in their rage?\u2019\nThat is an old device, and it was play\u2019d\nWhen I from Thebes came last a conqueror.\n\u2018The thrice three Muses mourning for the death\nOf learning, late deceas\u2019d in beggary.\u2019\nThat is some satire, keen and critical,\nNot sorting with a nuptial ceremony.\n\u2018A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus\nAnd his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.\u2019\nMerry and tragical? Tedious and brief?\nThat is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.\nHow shall we find the concord of this discord?\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nA play there is, my lord, some ten words long,\nWhich is as brief as I have known a play;\nBut by ten words, my lord, it is too long,\nWhich makes it tedious. For in all the play\nThere is not one word apt, one player fitted.\nAnd tragical, my noble lord, it is.\nFor Pyramus therein doth kill himself,\nWhich, when I saw rehears\u2019d, I must confess,\nMade mine eyes water; but more merry tears\nThe passion of loud laughter never shed.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWhat are they that do play it?\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nHard-handed men that work in Athens here,\nWhich never labour\u2019d in their minds till now;\nAnd now have toil\u2019d their unbreath\u2019d memories\nWith this same play against your nuptial.\n\nTHESEUS.\nAnd we will hear it.\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nNo, my noble lord,\nIt is not for you: I have heard it over,\nAnd it is nothing, nothing in the world;\nUnless you can find sport in their intents,\nExtremely stretch\u2019d and conn\u2019d with cruel pain\nTo do you service.\n\nTHESEUS.\nI will hear that play;\nFor never anything can be amiss\nWhen simpleness and duty tender it.\nGo, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.\n\n [_Exit Philostrate._]\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nI love not to see wretchedness o\u2019ercharged,\nAnd duty in his service perishing.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWhy, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nHe says they can do nothing in this kind.\n\nTHESEUS.\nThe kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.\nOur sport shall be to take what they mistake:\nAnd what poor duty cannot do, noble respect\nTakes it in might, not merit.\nWhere I have come, great clerks have purposed\nTo greet me with premeditated welcomes;\nWhere I have seen them shiver and look pale,\nMake periods in the midst of sentences,\nThrottle their practis\u2019d accent in their fears,\nAnd, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,\nNot paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,\nOut of this silence yet I pick\u2019d a welcome;\nAnd in the modesty of fearful duty\nI read as much as from the rattling tongue\nOf saucy and audacious eloquence.\nLove, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity\nIn least speak most to my capacity.\n\n Enter Philostrate.\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nSo please your grace, the Prologue is address\u2019d.\n\nTHESEUS.\nLet him approach.\n\n Flourish of trumpets. Enter the Prologue.\n\nPROLOGUE\nIf we offend, it is with our good will.\nThat you should think, we come not to offend,\nBut with good will.  To show our simple skill,\nThat is the true beginning of our end.\nConsider then, we come but in despite.\nWe do not come, as minding to content you,\nOur true intent is.  All for your delight\nWe are not here.  That you should here repent you,\nThe actors are at hand, and, by their show,\nYou shall know all that you are like to know.\n\nTHESEUS.\nThis fellow doth not stand upon points.\n\nLYSANDER.\nHe hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop. A\ngood moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nIndeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder; a\nsound, but not in government.\n\nTHESEUS.\nHis speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all\ndisordered. Who is next?\n\n Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine and Lion as in dumb show.\n\nPROLOGUE\nGentles, perchance you wonder at this show;\nBut wonder on, till truth make all things plain.\nThis man is Pyramus, if you would know;\nThis beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.\nThis man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present\nWall, that vile wall which did these lovers sunder;\nAnd through Wall\u2019s chink, poor souls, they are content\nTo whisper, at the which let no man wonder.\nThis man, with lanthern, dog, and bush of thorn,\nPresenteth Moonshine, for, if you will know,\nBy moonshine did these lovers think no scorn\nTo meet at Ninus\u2019 tomb, there, there to woo.\nThis grisly beast (which Lion hight by name)\nThe trusty Thisbe, coming first by night,\nDid scare away, or rather did affright;\nAnd as she fled, her mantle she did fall;\nWhich Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.\nAnon comes Pyramus, sweet youth, and tall,\nAnd finds his trusty Thisbe\u2019s mantle slain;\nWhereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,\nHe bravely broach\u2019d his boiling bloody breast;\nAnd Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,\nHis dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,\nLet Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,\nAt large discourse while here they do remain.\n\n [_Exeunt Prologue, Pyramus, Thisbe, Lion and Moonshine._]\n\nTHESEUS.\nI wonder if the lion be to speak.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNo wonder, my lord. One lion may, when many asses do.\n\nWALL.\nIn this same interlude it doth befall\nThat I, one Snout by name, present a wall:\nAnd such a wall as I would have you think\nThat had in it a crannied hole or chink,\nThrough which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,\nDid whisper often very secretly.\nThis loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show\nThat I am that same wall; the truth is so:\nAnd this the cranny is, right and sinister,\nThrough which the fearful lovers are to whisper.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWould you desire lime and hair to speak better?\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nIt is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.\n\nTHESEUS.\nPyramus draws near the wall; silence.\n\n Enter Pyramus.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nO grim-look\u2019d night! O night with hue so black!\nO night, which ever art when day is not!\nO night, O night, alack, alack, alack,\nI fear my Thisbe\u2019s promise is forgot!\nAnd thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,\nThat stand\u2019st between her father\u2019s ground and mine;\nThou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,\nShow me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.\n\n [_Wall holds up his fingers._]\n\nThanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!\nBut what see I? No Thisbe do I see.\nO wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,\nCurs\u2019d be thy stones for thus deceiving me!\n\nTHESEUS.\nThe wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nNo, in truth, sir, he should not. \u2018Deceiving me\u2019 is Thisbe\u2019s cue: she\nis to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see it\nwill fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.\n\n Enter Thisbe.\n\nTHISBE.\nO wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,\nFor parting my fair Pyramus and me.\nMy cherry lips have often kiss\u2019d thy stones,\nThy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nI see a voice; now will I to the chink,\nTo spy an I can hear my Thisbe\u2019s face.\nThisbe?\n\nTHISBE.\nMy love thou art, my love I think.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nThink what thou wilt, I am thy lover\u2019s grace;\nAnd like Limander am I trusty still.\n\nTHISBE.\nAnd I like Helen, till the fates me kill.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nNot Shafalus to Procrus was so true.\n\nTHISBE.\nAs Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nO kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.\n\nTHISBE.\nI kiss the wall\u2019s hole, not your lips at all.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nWilt thou at Ninny\u2019s tomb meet me straightway?\n\nTHISBE.\n\u2019Tide life, \u2019tide death, I come without delay.\n\nWALL.\nThus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;\nAnd, being done, thus Wall away doth go.\n\n [_Exeunt Wall, Pyramus and Thisbe._]\n\nTHESEUS.\nNow is the mural down between the two neighbours.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNo remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nThis is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.\n\nTHESEUS.\nThe best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if\nimagination amend them.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nIt must be your imagination then, and not theirs.\n\nTHESEUS.\nIf we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass\nfor excellent men. Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.\n\n Enter Lion and Moonshine.\n\nLION.\nYou, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear\nThe smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,\nMay now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,\nWhen lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.\nThen know that I, one Snug the joiner, am\nA lion fell, nor else no lion\u2019s dam;\nFor if I should as lion come in strife\nInto this place, \u2019twere pity on my life.\n\nTHESEUS.\nA very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nThe very best at a beast, my lord, that e\u2019er I saw.\n\nLYSANDER.\nThis lion is a very fox for his valour.\n\nTHESEUS.\nTrue; and a goose for his discretion.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNot so, my lord, for his valour cannot carry his discretion, and the\nfox carries the goose.\n\nTHESEUS.\nHis discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for the goose\ncarries not the fox. It is well; leave it to his discretion, and let us\nlisten to the moon.\n\nMOONSHINE.\nThis lanthorn doth the horn\u00e8d moon present.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nHe should have worn the horns on his head.\n\nTHESEUS.\nHe is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the\ncircumference.\n\nMOONSHINE.\nThis lanthorn doth the horn\u00e8d moon present;\nMyself the man i\u2019 the moon do seem to be.\n\nTHESEUS.\nThis is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should be put into\nthe lantern. How is it else the man i\u2019 the moon?\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nHe dares not come there for the candle, for you see, it is already in\nsnuff.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nI am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!\n\nTHESEUS.\nIt appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane; but\nyet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.\n\nLYSANDER.\nProceed, Moon.\n\nMOON\nAll that I have to say, is to tell you that the lantern is the moon; I\nthe man i\u2019 the moon; this thorn-bush my thorn-bush; and this dog my\ndog.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nWhy, all these should be in the lantern, for all these are in the moon.\nBut silence; here comes Thisbe.\n\n Enter Thisbe.\n\nTHISBE.\nThis is old Ninny\u2019s tomb. Where is my love?\n\nLION.\nOh!\n\n [_The Lion roars, Thisbe runs off._]\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nWell roared, Lion.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWell run, Thisbe.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nWell shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.\n\n [_The Lion tears Thisbe\u2019s mantle, and exit._]\n\nTHESEUS.\nWell moused, Lion.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAnd then came Pyramus.\n\nLYSANDER.\nAnd so the lion vanished.\n\n Enter Pyramus.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nSweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;\nI thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;\nFor, by thy gracious golden, glittering gleams,\nI trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.\n             But stay! O spite!\n             But mark, poor knight,\n         What dreadful dole is here!\n             Eyes, do you see?\n             How can it be?\n         O dainty duck! O dear!\n             Thy mantle good,\n             What, stained with blood?\n         Approach, ye Furies fell!\n             O Fates, come, come;\n             Cut thread and thrum;\n         Quail, rush, conclude, and quell!\n\nTHESEUS.\nThis passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a\nman look sad.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nBeshrew my heart, but I pity the man.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nO wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame,\nSince lion vile hath here deflower\u2019d my dear?\nWhich is\u2014no, no\u2014which was the fairest dame\nThat liv\u2019d, that lov\u2019d, that lik\u2019d, that look\u2019d with cheer.\n             Come, tears, confound!\n             Out, sword, and wound\n         The pap of Pyramus;\n             Ay, that left pap,\n             Where heart doth hop:\n         Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.\n             Now am I dead,\n             Now am I fled;\n         My soul is in the sky.\n             Tongue, lose thy light!\n             Moon, take thy flight!\n         Now die, die, die, die, die.\n\n [_Dies. Exit Moonshine._]\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNo die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.\n\nLYSANDER.\nLess than an ace, man; for he is dead, he is nothing.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWith the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nHow chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her\nlover?\n\n\nTHESEUS.\nShe will find him by starlight.\n\n Enter Thisbe.\n\nHere she comes, and her passion ends the play.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nMethinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus. I hope she\nwill be brief.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nA mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the\nbetter: he for a man, God warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us!\n\nLYSANDER.\nShe hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAnd thus she means, _videlicet_\u2014\n\nTHISBE.\n             Asleep, my love?\n             What, dead, my dove?\n         O Pyramus, arise,\n             Speak, speak. Quite dumb?\n             Dead, dead?

Will it\nplease you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between\ntwo of our company?\n\nTHESEUS.\nNo epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse;\nfor when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed. Marry,\nif he that writ it had played Pyramus, and hanged himself in Thisbe\u2019s\ngarter, it would have been a fine tragedy; and so it is, truly; and\nvery notably discharged. But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue\nalone.\n\n [_Here a dance of Clowns._]\n\nThe iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.\nLovers, to bed; \u2019tis almost fairy time.\nI fear we shall outsleep the coming morn\nAs much as we this night have overwatch\u2019d.\nThis palpable-gross play hath well beguil\u2019d\nThe heavy gait of night.
