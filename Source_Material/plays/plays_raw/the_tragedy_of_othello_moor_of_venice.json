Venice. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Roderigo and Iago.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nTush, never tell me, I take it much unkindly\r\nThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purse,\r\nAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n\u2019Sblood, but you will not hear me.\r\nIf ever I did dream of such a matter,\r\nAbhor me.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nThou told\u2019st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDespise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,\r\nIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\r\nOff-capp\u2019d to him; and by the faith of man,\r\nI know my price, I am worth no worse a place.\r\nBut he, as loving his own pride and purposes,\r\nEvades them, with a bombast circumstance,\r\nHorribly stuff\u2019d with epithets of war:\r\nAnd in conclusion,\r\nNonsuits my mediators: for \u201cCertes,\u201d says he,\r\n\u201cI have already chose my officer.\u201d\r\nAnd what was he?\r\nForsooth, a great arithmetician,\r\nOne Michael Cassio, a Florentine,\r\nA fellow almost damn\u2019d in a fair wife,\r\nThat never set a squadron in the field,\r\nNor the division of a battle knows\r\nMore than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,\r\nWherein the toged consuls can propose\r\nAs masterly as he: mere prattle without practice\r\nIs all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,\r\nAnd I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\r\nAt Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,\r\nChristian and heathen, must be belee\u2019d and calm\u2019d\r\nBy debitor and creditor, this counter-caster,\r\nHe, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\r\nAnd I, God bless the mark, his Moorship\u2019s ancient.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, there\u2019s no remedy. \u2019Tis the curse of service,\r\nPreferment goes by letter and affection,\r\nAnd not by old gradation, where each second\r\nStood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself\r\nWhether I in any just term am affin\u2019d\r\nTo love the Moor.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI would not follow him, then.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO, sir, content you.\r\nI follow him to serve my turn upon him:\r\nWe cannot all be masters, nor all masters\r\nCannot be truly follow\u2019d. You shall mark\r\nMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave\r\nThat, doting on his own obsequious bondage,\r\nWears out his time, much like his master\u2019s ass,\r\nFor nought but provender, and when he\u2019s old, cashier\u2019d.\r\nWhip me such honest knaves. Others there are\r\nWho, trimm\u2019d in forms, and visages of duty,\r\nKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves,\r\nAnd throwing but shows of service on their lords,\r\nDo well thrive by them, and when they have lin\u2019d their coats,\r\nDo themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,\r\nAnd such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,\r\nIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,\r\nWere I the Moor, I would not be Iago:\r\nIn following him, I follow but myself.\r\nHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\r\nBut seeming so for my peculiar end.\r\nFor when my outward action doth demonstrate\r\nThe native act and figure of my heart\r\nIn complement extern, \u2019tis not long after\r\nBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve\r\nFor daws to peck at: I am not what I am.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhat a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,\r\nIf he can carry\u2019t thus!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCall up her father,\r\nRouse him, make after him, poison his delight,\r\nProclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,\r\nAnd though he in a fertile climate dwell,\r\nPlague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,\r\nYet throw such changes of vexation on\u2019t,\r\nAs it may lose some color.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nHere is her father\u2019s house, I\u2019ll call aloud.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDo, with like timorous accent and dire yell\r\nAs when, by night and negligence, the fire\r\nIs spied in populous cities.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhat ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAwake! what ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!\r\nLook to your house, your daughter, and your bags!\r\nThieves, thieves!\r\n\r\n Brabantio appears above at a window.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nWhat is the reason of this terrible summons?\r\nWhat is the matter there?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nSignior, is all your family within?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAre your doors locked?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nWhy, wherefore ask you this?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nZounds, sir, you\u2019re robb\u2019d, for shame put on your gown,\r\nYour heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;\r\nEven now, now, very now, an old black ram\r\nIs tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise,\r\nAwake the snorting citizens with the bell,\r\nOr else the devil will make a grandsire of you:\r\nArise, I say.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nWhat, have you lost your wits?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nMost reverend signior, do you know my voice?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nNot I. What are you?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nMy name is Roderigo.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nThe worser welcome.\r\nI have charg\u2019d thee not to haunt about my doors;\r\nIn honest plainness thou hast heard me say\r\nMy daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,\r\nBeing full of supper and distempering draughts,\r\nUpon malicious bravery, dost thou come\r\nTo start my quiet.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nSir, sir, sir,\u2014\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nBut thou must needs be sure\r\nMy spirit and my place have in them power\r\nTo make this bitter to thee.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nPatience, good sir.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nWhat tell\u2019st thou me of robbing?\r\nThis is Venice. My house is not a grange.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nMost grave Brabantio,\r\nIn simple and pure soul I come to you.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nZounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil\r\nbid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are\r\nruffians, you\u2019ll have your daughter cover\u2019d with a Barbary horse;\r\nyou\u2019ll have your nephews neigh to you; you\u2019ll have coursers for cousins\r\nand gennets for germans.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nWhat profane wretch art thou?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are\r\nnow making the beast with two backs.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nThou art a villain.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou are a senator.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nThis thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nSir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,\r\nIf \u2019t be your pleasure, and most wise consent,\r\n(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,\r\nAt this odd-even and dull watch o\u2019 the night,\r\nTransported with no worse nor better guard,\r\nBut with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,\r\nTo the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:\r\nIf this be known to you, and your allowance,\r\nWe then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.\r\nBut if you know not this, my manners tell me,\r\nWe have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe\r\nThat from the sense of all civility,\r\nI thus would play and trifle with your reverence.\r\nYour daughter (if you have not given her leave)\r\nI say again, hath made a gross revolt,\r\nTying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes\r\nIn an extravagant and wheeling stranger\r\nOf here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:\r\nIf she be in her chamber or your house,\r\nLet loose on me the justice of the state\r\nFor thus deluding you.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nStrike on the tinder, ho!\r\nGive me a taper! Call up all my people!\r\nThis accident is not unlike my dream,\r\nBelief of it oppresses me already.\r\nLight, I say, light!\r\n\r\n [_Exit from above._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nFarewell; for I must leave you:\r\nIt seems not meet nor wholesome to my place\r\nTo be produc\u2019d, as if I stay I shall,\r\nAgainst the Moor. For I do know the state,\r\nHowever this may gall him with some check,\r\nCannot with safety cast him, for he\u2019s embark\u2019d\r\nWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,\r\nWhich even now stand in act, that, for their souls,\r\nAnother of his fathom they have none\r\nTo lead their business. In which regard,\r\nThough I do hate him as I do hell pains,\r\nYet, for necessity of present life,\r\nI must show out a flag and sign of love,\r\nWhich is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,\r\nLead to the Sagittary the raised search,\r\nAnd there will I be with him. So, farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Enter Brabantio with Servants and torches.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nIt is too true an evil. Gone she is,\r\nAnd what\u2019s to come of my despised time,\r\nIs naught but bitterness. Now Roderigo,\r\nWhere didst thou see her? (O unhappy girl!)\r\nWith the Moor, say\u2019st thou? (Who would be a father!)\r\nHow didst thou know \u2019twas she? (O, she deceives me\r\nPast thought.) What said she to you? Get more tapers,\r\nRaise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nTruly I think they are.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nO heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!\r\nFathers, from hence trust not your daughters\u2019 minds\r\nBy what you see them act. Is there not charms\r\nBy which the property of youth and maidhood\r\nMay be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,\r\nOf some such thing?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nYes, sir, I have indeed.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nCall up my brother. O, would you had had her!\r\nSome one way, some another. Do you know\r\nWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI think I can discover him, if you please\r\nTo get good guard, and go along with me.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nPray you lead on. At every house I\u2019ll call,\r\nI may command at most. Get weapons, ho!\r\nAnd raise some special officers of night.\r\nOn, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Venice. Another street.\r\n\r\n Enter Othello, Iago and Attendants with torches.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThough in the trade of war I have slain men,\r\nYet do I hold it very stuff o\u2019 the conscience\r\nTo do no contriv\u2019d murder; I lack iniquity\r\nSometimes to do me service: nine or ten times\r\nI had thought to have yerk\u2019d him here under the ribs.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n\u2019Tis better as it is.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNay, but he prated,\r\nAnd spoke such scurvy and provoking terms\r\nAgainst your honour,\r\nThat with the little godliness I have,\r\nI did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,\r\nAre you fast married? Be assur\u2019d of this,\r\nThat the magnifico is much belov\u2019d\r\nAnd hath in his effect a voice potential\r\nAs double as the duke\u2019s; he will divorce you,\r\nOr put upon you what restraint and grievance\r\nThe law (with all his might to enforce it on)\r\nWill give him cable.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nLet him do his spite;\r\nMy services, which I have done the signiory,\r\nShall out-tongue his complaints. \u2019Tis yet to know,\u2014\r\nWhich, when I know that boasting is an honour,\r\nI shall promulgate,\u2014I fetch my life and being\r\nFrom men of royal siege. And my demerits\r\nMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune\r\nAs this that I have reach\u2019d. For know, Iago,\r\nBut that I love the gentle Desdemona,\r\nI would not my unhoused free condition\r\nPut into circumscription and confine\r\nFor the sea\u2019s worth. But look, what lights come yond?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThose are the raised father and his friends:\r\nYou were best go in.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNot I; I must be found.\r\nMy parts, my title, and my perfect soul\r\nShall manifest me rightly. Is it they?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBy Janus, I think no.\r\n\r\n Enter Cassio and Officers with torches.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe servants of the duke and my lieutenant.\r\nThe goodness of the night upon you, friends!\r\nWhat is the news?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThe duke does greet you, general,\r\nAnd he requires your haste-post-haste appearance\r\nEven on the instant.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat is the matter, think you?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nSomething from Cyprus, as I may divine.\r\nIt is a business of some heat. The galleys\r\nHave sent a dozen sequent messengers\r\nThis very night at one another\u2019s heels;\r\nAnd many of the consuls, rais\u2019d and met,\r\nAre at the duke\u2019s already. You have been hotly call\u2019d for,\r\nWhen, being not at your lodging to be found,\r\nThe senate hath sent about three several quests\r\nTo search you out.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n\u2019Tis well I am found by you.\r\nI will but spend a word here in the house,\r\nAnd go with you.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAncient, what makes he here?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nFaith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack:\r\nIf it prove lawful prize, he\u2019s made forever.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI do not understand.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHe\u2019s married.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nTo who?\r\n\r\n Enter Othello.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMarry to\u2014Come, captain, will you go?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHave with you.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHere comes another troop to seek for you.\r\n\r\n Enter Brabantio, Roderigo and Officers with torches and weapons.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIt is Brabantio. General, be advis\u2019d,\r\nHe comes to bad intent.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHolla, stand there!\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nSignior, it is the Moor.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nDown with him, thief!\r\n\r\n [_They draw on both sides._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nKeep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.\r\nGood signior, you shall more command with years\r\nThan with your weapons.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nO thou foul thief, where hast thou stow\u2019d my daughter?\r\nDamn\u2019d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,\r\nFor I\u2019ll refer me to all things of sense,\r\n(If she in chains of magic were not bound)\r\nWhether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,\r\nSo opposite to marriage, that she shunn\u2019d\r\nThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\r\nWould ever have, to incur a general mock,\r\nRun from her guardage to the sooty bosom\r\nOf such a thing as thou\u2014to fear, not to delight.\r\nJudge me the world, if \u2019tis not gross in sense,\r\nThat thou hast practis\u2019d on her with foul charms,\r\nAbus\u2019d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals\r\nThat weakens motion. I\u2019ll have\u2019t disputed on;\r\n\u2019Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.\r\nI therefore apprehend and do attach thee\r\nFor an abuser of the world, a practiser\r\nOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.\u2014\r\nLay hold upon him, if he do resist,\r\nSubdue him at his peril.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHold your hands,\r\nBoth you of my inclining and the rest:\r\nWere it my cue to fight, I should have known it\r\nWithout a prompter. Where will you that I go\r\nTo answer this your charge?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nTo prison, till fit time\r\nOf law and course of direct session\r\nCall thee to answer.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat if I do obey?\r\nHow may the duke be therewith satisfied,\r\nWhose messengers are here about my side,\r\nUpon some present business of the state,\r\nTo bring me to him?\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\n\u2019Tis true, most worthy signior,\r\nThe duke\u2019s in council, and your noble self,\r\nI am sure is sent for.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nHow? The duke in council?\r\nIn this time of the night? Bring him away;\r\nMine\u2019s not an idle cause. The duke himself,\r\nOr any of my brothers of the state,\r\nCannot but feel this wrong as \u2019twere their own.\r\nFor if such actions may have passage free,\r\nBond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Venice. A council chamber.\r\n\r\n The Duke and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThere is no composition in these news\r\nThat gives them credit.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nIndeed, they are disproportion\u2019d;\r\nMy letters say a hundred and seven galleys.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAnd mine a hundred and forty.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR\r\nAnd mine two hundred:\r\nBut though they jump not on a just account,\r\n(As in these cases, where the aim reports,\r\n\u2019Tis oft with difference,) yet do they all confirm\r\nA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNay, it is possible enough to judgement:\r\nI do not so secure me in the error,\r\nBut the main article I do approve\r\nIn fearful sense.\r\n\r\nSAILOR.\r\n[_Within._] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\nA messenger from the galleys.\r\n\r\n Enter Sailor.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNow,\u2014what\u2019s the business?\r\n\r\nSAILOR.\r\nThe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,\r\nSo was I bid report here to the state\r\nBy Signior Angelo.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHow say you by this change?\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nThis cannot be\r\nBy no assay of reason. \u2019Tis a pageant\r\nTo keep us in false gaze. When we consider\r\nThe importancy of Cyprus to the Turk;\r\nAnd let ourselves again but understand\r\nThat, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,\r\nSo may he with more facile question bear it,\r\nFor that it stands not in such warlike brace,\r\nBut altogether lacks the abilities\r\nThat Rhodes is dress\u2019d in. If we make thought of this,\r\nWe must not think the Turk is so unskilful\r\nTo leave that latest which concerns him first,\r\nNeglecting an attempt of ease and gain,\r\nTo wake and wage a danger profitless.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNay, in all confidence, he\u2019s not for Rhodes.\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\nHere is more news.\r\n\r\n Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nThe Ottomites, reverend and gracious,\r\nSteering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,\r\nHave there injointed them with an after fleet.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nAy, so I thought. How many, as you guess?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nOf thirty sail, and now they do re-stem\r\nTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearance\r\nTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,\r\nYour trusty and most valiant servitor,\r\nWith his free duty recommends you thus,\r\nAnd prays you to believe him.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n\u2019Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.\r\nMarcus Luccicos, is not he in town?\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nHe\u2019s now in Florence.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWrite from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.\r\n\r\n Enter Brabantio, Othello, Iago, Roderigo and Officers.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nValiant Othello, we must straight employ you\r\nAgainst the general enemy Ottoman.\r\n[_To Brabantio._] I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior,\r\nWe lack\u2019d your counsel and your help tonight.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nSo did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me.\r\nNeither my place, nor aught I heard of business\r\nHath rais\u2019d me from my bed, nor doth the general care\r\nTake hold on me; for my particular grief\r\nIs of so flood-gate and o\u2019erbearing nature\r\nThat it engluts and swallows other sorrows,\r\nAnd it is still itself.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhy, what\u2019s the matter?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nMy daughter! O, my daughter!\r\n\r\nDUKE and SENATORS.\r\nDead?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nAy, to me.\r\nShe is abused, stol\u2019n from me, and corrupted\r\nBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;\r\nFor nature so preposterously to err,\r\nBeing not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,\r\nSans witchcraft could not.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhoe\u2019er he be, that in this foul proceeding,\r\nHath thus beguil\u2019d your daughter of herself,\r\nAnd you of her, the bloody book of law\r\nYou shall yourself read in the bitter letter,\r\nAfter your own sense, yea, though our proper son\r\nStood in your action.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nHumbly I thank your grace.\r\nHere is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems\r\nYour special mandate for the state affairs\r\nHath hither brought.\r\n\r\nALL.\r\nWe are very sorry for \u2019t.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n[_To Othello._] What, in your own part, can you say to this?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nNothing, but this is so.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nMost potent, grave, and reverend signiors,\r\nMy very noble and approv\u2019d good masters:\r\nThat I have ta\u2019en away this old man\u2019s daughter,\r\nIt is most true; true, I have married her.\r\nThe very head and front of my offending\r\nHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,\r\nAnd little bless\u2019d with the soft phrase of peace;\r\nFor since these arms of mine had seven years\u2019 pith,\r\nTill now some nine moons wasted, they have us\u2019d\r\nTheir dearest action in the tented field,\r\nAnd little of this great world can I speak,\r\nMore than pertains to feats of broil and battle,\r\nAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause\r\nIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,\r\nI will a round unvarnish\u2019d tale deliver\r\nOf my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,\r\nWhat conjuration, and what mighty magic,\r\n(For such proceeding I am charged withal)\r\nI won his daughter.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nA maiden never bold:\r\nOf spirit so still and quiet that her motion\r\nBlush\u2019d at herself; and she, in spite of nature,\r\nOf years, of country, credit, everything,\r\nTo fall in love with what she fear\u2019d to look on!\r\nIt is judgement maim\u2019d and most imperfect\r\nThat will confess perfection so could err\r\nAgainst all rules of nature, and must be driven\r\nTo find out practices of cunning hell,\r\nWhy this should be. I therefore vouch again,\r\nThat with some mixtures powerful o\u2019er the blood,\r\nOr with some dram conjur\u2019d to this effect,\r\nHe wrought upon her.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nTo vouch this is no proof;\r\nWithout more wider and more overt test\r\nThan these thin habits and poor likelihoods\r\nOf modern seeming do prefer against him.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nBut, Othello, speak:\r\nDid you by indirect and forced courses\r\nSubdue and poison this young maid\u2019s affections?\r\nOr came it by request, and such fair question\r\nAs soul to soul affordeth?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI do beseech you,\r\nSend for the lady to the Sagittary,\r\nAnd let her speak of me before her father.\r\nIf you do find me foul in her report,\r\nThe trust, the office I do hold of you,\r\nNot only take away, but let your sentence\r\nEven fall upon my life.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nFetch Desdemona hither.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAncient, conduct them, you best know the place.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Iago and Attendants._]\r\n\r\nAnd till she come, as truly as to heaven\r\nI do confess the vices of my blood,\r\nSo justly to your grave ears I\u2019ll present\r\nHow I did thrive in this fair lady\u2019s love,\r\nAnd she in mine.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSay it, Othello.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHer father lov\u2019d me, oft invited me,\r\nStill question\u2019d me the story of my life,\r\nFrom year to year\u2014the battles, sieges, fortunes,\r\nThat I have pass\u2019d.\r\nI ran it through, even from my boyish days\r\nTo the very moment that he bade me tell it,\r\nWherein I spake of most disastrous chances,\r\nOf moving accidents by flood and field;\r\nOf hair-breadth scapes i\u2019 th\u2019 imminent deadly breach;\r\nOf being taken by the insolent foe,\r\nAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,\r\nAnd portance in my traveler\u2019s history,\r\nWherein of antres vast and deserts idle,\r\nRough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,\r\nIt was my hint to speak,\u2014such was the process;\r\nAnd of the Cannibals that each other eat,\r\nThe Anthropophagi, and men whose heads\r\nDo grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear\r\nWould Desdemona seriously incline.\r\nBut still the house affairs would draw her thence,\r\nWhich ever as she could with haste dispatch,\r\nShe\u2019d come again, and with a greedy ear\r\nDevour up my discourse; which I observing,\r\nTook once a pliant hour, and found good means\r\nTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart\r\nThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,\r\nWhereof by parcels she had something heard,\r\nBut not intentively. I did consent,\r\nAnd often did beguile her of her tears,\r\nWhen I did speak of some distressful stroke\r\nThat my youth suffer\u2019d. My story being done,\r\nShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs.\r\nShe swore, in faith, \u2019twas strange, \u2019twas passing strange;\r\n\u2019Twas pitiful, \u2019twas wondrous pitiful.\r\nShe wish\u2019d she had not heard it, yet she wish\u2019d\r\nThat heaven had made her such a man: she thank\u2019d me,\r\nAnd bade me, if I had a friend that lov\u2019d her,\r\nI should but teach him how to tell my story,\r\nAnd that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:\r\nShe lov\u2019d me for the dangers I had pass\u2019d,\r\nAnd I lov\u2019d her that she did pity them.\r\nThis only is the witchcraft I have us\u2019d.\r\nHere comes the lady. Let her witness it.\r\n\r\n Enter  Desdemona, Iago and Attendants.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI think this tale would win my daughter too.\r\nGood Brabantio,\r\nTake up this mangled matter at the best.\r\nMen do their broken weapons rather use\r\nThan their bare hands.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nI pray you hear her speak.\r\nIf she confess that she was half the wooer,\r\nDestruction on my head, if my bad blame\r\nLight on the man!\u2014Come hither, gentle mistress:\r\nDo you perceive in all this noble company\r\nWhere most you owe obedience?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nMy noble father,\r\nI do perceive here a divided duty:\r\nTo you I am bound for life and education.\r\nMy life and education both do learn me\r\nHow to respect you. You are the lord of duty,\r\nI am hitherto your daughter: but here\u2019s my husband.\r\nAnd so much duty as my mother show\u2019d\r\nTo you, preferring you before her father,\r\nSo much I challenge that I may profess\r\nDue to the Moor my lord.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nGod be with you! I have done.\r\nPlease it your grace, on to the state affairs.\r\nI had rather to adopt a child than get it.\u2014\r\nCome hither, Moor:\r\nI here do give thee that with all my heart\r\nWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heart\r\nI would keep from thee.\u2014For your sake, jewel,\r\nI am glad at soul I have no other child,\r\nFor thy escape would teach me tyranny,\r\nTo hang clogs on them.\u2014I have done, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLet me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,\r\nWhich as a grise or step may help these lovers\r\nInto your favour.\r\nWhen remedies are past, the griefs are ended\r\nBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.\r\nTo mourn a mischief that is past and gone\r\nIs the next way to draw new mischief on.\r\nWhat cannot be preserved when fortune takes,\r\nPatience her injury a mockery makes.\r\nThe robb\u2019d that smiles steals something from the thief;\r\nHe robs himself that spends a bootless grief.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nSo let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,\r\nWe lose it not so long as we can smile;\r\nHe bears the sentence well, that nothing bears\r\nBut the free comfort which from thence he hears;\r\nBut he bears both the sentence and the sorrow\r\nThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.\r\nThese sentences to sugar or to gall,\r\nBeing strong on both sides, are equivocal:\r\nBut words are words; I never yet did hear\r\nThat the bruis\u2019d heart was pierced through the ear.\r\nI humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThe Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the\r\nfortitude of the place is best known to you. And though we have there a\r\nsubstitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign\r\nmistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must\r\ntherefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with\r\nthis more stubborn and boisterous expedition.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe tyrant custom, most grave senators,\r\nHath made the flinty and steel couch of war\r\nMy thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize\r\nA natural and prompt alacrity\r\nI find in hardness, and do undertake\r\nThis present wars against the Ottomites.\r\nMost humbly, therefore, bending to your state,\r\nI crave fit disposition for my wife,\r\nDue reference of place and exhibition,\r\nWith such accommodation and besort\r\nAs levels with her breeding.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIf you please,\r\nBe\u2019t at her father\u2019s.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nI\u2019ll not have it so.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNor I.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nNor I. I would not there reside,\r\nTo put my father in impatient thoughts,\r\nBy being in his eye. Most gracious duke,\r\nTo my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,\r\nAnd let me find a charter in your voice\r\nT\u2019 assist my simpleness.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat would you, Desdemona?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nThat I did love the Moor to live with him,\r\nMy downright violence and storm of fortunes\r\nMay trumpet to the world: my heart\u2019s subdued\r\nEven to the very quality of my lord.\r\nI saw Othello\u2019s visage in his mind,\r\nAnd to his honours and his valiant parts\r\nDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate.\r\nSo that, dear lords, if I be left behind,\r\nA moth of peace, and he go to the war,\r\nThe rites for which I love him are bereft me,\r\nAnd I a heavy interim shall support\r\nBy his dear absence. Let me go with him.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nLet her have your voice.\r\nVouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not\r\nTo please the palate of my appetite,\r\nNor to comply with heat, the young affects\r\nIn me defunct, and proper satisfaction,\r\nBut to be free and bounteous to her mind.\r\nAnd heaven defend your good souls that you think\r\nI will your serious and great business scant\r\nFor she is with me. No, when light-wing\u2019d toys\r\nOf feather\u2019d Cupid seel with wanton dullness\r\nMy speculative and offic\u2019d instruments,\r\nThat my disports corrupt and taint my business,\r\nLet housewives make a skillet of my helm,\r\nAnd all indign and base adversities\r\nMake head against my estimation.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBe it as you shall privately determine,\r\nEither for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,\r\nAnd speed must answer it.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nYou must away tonight.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWith all my heart.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAt nine i\u2019 the morning here we\u2019ll meet again.\r\nOthello, leave some officer behind,\r\nAnd he shall our commission bring to you,\r\nWith such things else of quality and respect\r\nAs doth import you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nSo please your grace, my ancient,\r\nA man he is of honesty and trust,\r\nTo his conveyance I assign my wife,\r\nWith what else needful your good grace shall think\r\nTo be sent after me.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLet it be so.\r\nGood night to everyone. [_To Brabantio._] And, noble signior,\r\nIf virtue no delighted beauty lack,\r\nYour son-in-law is far more fair than black.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nAdieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nLook to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:\r\nShe has deceiv\u2019d her father, and may thee.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Duke, Senators, Officers, &c._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nMy life upon her faith! Honest Iago,\r\nMy Desdemona must I leave to thee.\r\nI prithee, let thy wife attend on her,\r\nAnd bring them after in the best advantage.\u2014\r\nCome, Desdemona, I have but an hour\r\nOf love, of worldly matters, and direction,\r\nTo spend with thee. We must obey the time.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Othello and Desdemona._]\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nIago\u2014\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat sayst thou, noble heart?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhat will I do, thinkest thou?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, go to bed and sleep.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI will incontinently drown myself.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIf thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman!\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nIt is silliness to live, when to live is torment; and then have we a\r\nprescription to die when death is our physician.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years,\r\nand since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never\r\nfound man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown\r\nmyself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a\r\nbaboon.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhat should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not\r\nin my virtue to amend it.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nVirtue! a fig! \u2019Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies\r\nare gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will\r\nplant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it\r\nwith one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it\r\nsterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and\r\ncorrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our\r\nlives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the\r\nblood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous\r\nconclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal\r\nstings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to\r\nbe a sect, or scion.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nIt cannot be.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIt is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be\r\na man. Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me\r\nthy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of\r\nperdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put\r\nmoney in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with an\r\nusurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that\r\nDesdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,\u2014put money in thy\r\npurse,\u2014nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt\r\nsee an answerable sequestration\u2014put but money in thy purse. These Moors\r\nare changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that\r\nto him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb\r\nas the coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with\r\nhis body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change,\r\nshe must. Therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn\r\nthyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money\r\nthou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian\r\nand a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the\r\ntribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of\r\ndrowning thyself! It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be\r\nhanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often, and I\r\nretell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted;\r\nthine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against\r\nhim: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a\r\nsport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be\r\ndelivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this\r\ntomorrow. Adieu.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhere shall we meet i\u2019 the morning?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAt my lodging.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI\u2019ll be with thee betimes.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nGo to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhat say you?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNo more of drowning, do you hear?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI am changed. I\u2019ll sell all my land.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThus do I ever make my fool my purse.\r\nFor I mine own gain\u2019d knowledge should profane\r\nIf I would time expend with such a snipe\r\nBut for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,\r\nAnd it is thought abroad that \u2019twixt my sheets\r\nHe has done my office. I know not if \u2019t be true,\r\nBut I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\r\nWill do as if for surety. He holds me well,\r\nThe better shall my purpose work on him.\r\nCassio\u2019s a proper man. Let me see now,\r\nTo get his place, and to plume up my will\r\nIn double knavery. How, how? Let\u2019s see.\r\nAfter some time, to abuse Othello\u2019s ear\r\nThat he is too familiar with his wife.\r\nHe hath a person and a smooth dispose,\r\nTo be suspected, fram\u2019d to make women false.\r\nThe Moor is of a free and open nature\r\nThat thinks men honest that but seem to be so,\r\nAnd will as tenderly be led by the nose\r\nAs asses are.\r\nI have\u2019t. It is engender\u2019d. Hell and night\r\nMust bring this monstrous birth to the world\u2019s light.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II.\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A seaport in Cyprus. A Platform.\r\n\r\n Enter Montano and two Gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nWhat from the cape can you discern at sea?\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nNothing at all, it is a high-wrought flood.\r\nI cannot \u2019twixt the heaven and the main\r\nDescry a sail.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nMethinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land.\r\nA fuller blast ne\u2019er shook our battlements.\r\nIf it hath ruffian\u2019d so upon the sea,\r\nWhat ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,\r\nCan hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nA segregation of the Turkish fleet.\r\nFor do but stand upon the foaming shore,\r\nThe chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,\r\nThe wind-shak\u2019d surge, with high and monstrous main,\r\nSeems to cast water on the burning Bear,\r\nAnd quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole;\r\nI never did like molestation view\r\nOn the enchafed flood.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nIf that the Turkish fleet\r\nBe not enshelter\u2019d, and embay\u2019d, they are drown\u2019d.\r\nIt is impossible to bear it out.\r\n\r\n Enter a third Gentleman.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nNews, lads! Our wars are done.\r\nThe desperate tempest hath so bang\u2019d the Turks\r\nThat their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice\r\nHath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance\r\nOn most part of their fleet.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nHow? Is this true?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nThe ship is here put in,\r\nA Veronessa; Michael Cassio,\r\nLieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,\r\nIs come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,\r\nAnd is in full commission here for Cyprus.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nI am glad on\u2019t. \u2019Tis a worthy governor.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nBut this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort\r\nTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,\r\nAnd prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted\r\nWith foul and violent tempest.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nPray heavens he be;\r\nFor I have serv\u2019d him, and the man commands\r\nLike a full soldier. Let\u2019s to the sea-side, ho!\r\nAs well to see the vessel that\u2019s come in\r\nAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,\r\nEven till we make the main and the aerial blue\r\nAn indistinct regard.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nCome, let\u2019s do so;\r\nFor every minute is expectancy\r\nOf more arrivance.\r\n\r\n Enter Cassio.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThanks you, the valiant of this warlike isle,\r\nThat so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens\r\nGive him defence against the elements,\r\nFor I have lost him on a dangerous sea.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nIs he well shipp\u2019d?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHis bark is stoutly timber\u2019d, and his pilot\r\nOf very expert and approv\u2019d allowance;\r\nTherefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,\r\nStand in bold cure.\r\n\r\n[_Within._] A sail, a sail, a sail!\r\n\r\n Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWhat noise?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nThe town is empty; on the brow o\u2019 the sea\r\nStand ranks of people, and they cry \u201cA sail!\u201d\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMy hopes do shape him for the governor.\r\n\r\n [_A shot._]\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nThey do discharge their shot of courtesy.\r\nOur friends at least.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI pray you, sir, go forth,\r\nAnd give us truth who \u2019tis that is arriv\u2019d.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nI shall.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nBut, good lieutenant, is your general wiv\u2019d?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMost fortunately: he hath achiev\u2019d a maid\r\nThat paragons description and wild fame,\r\nOne that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,\r\nAnd in the essential vesture of creation\r\nDoes tire the ingener.\r\n\r\n Enter second Gentleman.\r\n\r\nHow now? Who has put in?\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\n\u2019Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHe has had most favourable and happy speed:\r\nTempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,\r\nThe gutter\u2019d rocks, and congregated sands,\r\nTraitors ensteep\u2019d to clog the guiltless keel,\r\nAs having sense of beauty, do omit\r\nTheir mortal natures, letting go safely by\r\nThe divine Desdemona.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nWhat is she?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nShe that I spake of, our great captain\u2019s captain,\r\nLeft in the conduct of the bold Iago;\r\nWhose footing here anticipates our thoughts\r\nA se\u2019nnight\u2019s speed.

If such tricks as these strip you out of your\r\nlieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers\r\nso oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good;\r\nwell kissed, an excellent courtesy! \u2019Tis so, indeed. Yet again your\r\nfingers to your lips?

O my sweet,\r\nI prattle out of fashion, and I dote\r\nIn mine own comforts.\u2014I prithee, good Iago,\r\nGo to the bay and disembark my coffers.\r\nBring thou the master to the citadel;\r\nHe is a good one, and his worthiness\r\nDoes challenge much respect.\u2014Come, Desdemona,\r\nOnce more well met at Cyprus.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Othello, Desdemona and Attendants._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDo thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come hither. If thou be\u2019st\r\nvaliant\u2014as, they say, base men being in love have then a nobility in\r\ntheir natures more than is native to them\u2014list me. The lieutenant\r\ntonight watches on the court of guard: first, I must tell thee this:\r\nDesdemona is directly in love with him.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWith him? Why, \u2019tis not possible.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nLay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what\r\nviolence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging, and telling her\r\nfantastical lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy\r\ndiscreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall\r\nshe have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act\r\nof sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a\r\nfresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners, and\r\nbeauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these\r\nrequired conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused,\r\nbegin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor, very nature\r\nwill instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now sir,\r\nthis granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforced position) who\r\nstands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a\r\nknave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere\r\nform of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt\r\nand most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none! A slipper and\r\nsubtle knave, a finder out of occasions; that has an eye can stamp and\r\ncounterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself: a\r\ndevilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all\r\nthose requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A\r\npestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI cannot believe that in her, she is full of most blessed condition.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBlest fig\u2019s end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been\r\nblessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst\r\nthou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nYes, that I did. But that was but courtesy.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nLechery, by this hand. An index and obscure prologue to the history of\r\nlust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their\r\nbreaths embrac\u2019d together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these\r\nmutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main\r\nexercise, the incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by\r\nme. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight. For the command,\r\nI\u2019ll lay\u2019t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I\u2019ll not be far from you. Do\r\nyou find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or\r\ntainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which\r\nthe time shall more favourably minister.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWell.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nSir, he is rash, and very sudden in choler, and haply with his\r\ntruncheon may strike at you: provoke him that he may, for even out of\r\nthat will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall\r\ncome into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So\r\nshall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall\r\nthen have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed,\r\nwithout the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must fetch his\r\nnecessaries ashore. Farewell.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThat Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;\r\nThat she loves him, \u2019tis apt, and of great credit:\r\nThe Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,\r\nIs of a constant, loving, noble nature;\r\nAnd, I dare think, he\u2019ll prove to Desdemona\r\nA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,\r\nNot out of absolute lust (though peradventure\r\nI stand accountant for as great a sin)\r\nBut partly led to diet my revenge,\r\nFor that I do suspect the lusty Moor\r\nHath leap\u2019d into my seat. The thought whereof\r\nDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,\r\nAnd nothing can or shall content my soul\r\nTill I am even\u2019d with him, wife for wife,\r\nOr, failing so, yet that I put the Moor\r\nAt least into a jealousy so strong\r\nThat judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,\r\nIf this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash\r\nFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on,\r\nI\u2019ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,\r\nAbuse him to the Moor in the rank garb\r\n(For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too)\r\nMake the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me\r\nFor making him egregiously an ass\r\nAnd practicing upon his peace and quiet\r\nEven to madness. \u2019Tis here, but yet confus\u2019d.\r\nKnavery\u2019s plain face is never seen till us\u2019d.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Othello\u2019s Herald with a proclamation.\r\n\r\nHERALD.\r\nIt is Othello\u2019s pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that upon\r\ncertain tidings now arrived, importing the mere perdition of the\r\nTurkish fleet, every man put himself into triumph: some to dance, some\r\nto make bonfires, each man to what sport and revels his addition leads\r\nhim. For besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his\r\nnuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are\r\nopen, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of\r\nfive till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus\r\nand our noble general Othello!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

Tomorrow with your earliest\r\nLet me have speech with you. [_To Desdemona._] Come, my dear love,\r\nThe purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;\r\nThat profit\u2019s yet to come \u2019tween me and you.\u2014\r\nGood night.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Othello, Desdemona and Attendants._]\r\n\r\n Enter Iago.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWelcome, Iago. We must to the watch.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNot this hour, lieutenant. \u2019Tis not yet ten o\u2019 th\u2019 clock. Our general\r\ncast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not\r\ntherefore blame: he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and\r\nshe is sport for Jove.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nShe\u2019s a most exquisite lady.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd, I\u2019ll warrant her, full of game.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nIndeed, she is a most fresh and delicate creature.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAn inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd when she speaks, is it not an alarm to love?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nShe is indeed perfection.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWell, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of\r\nwine; and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain\r\nhave a measure to the health of black Othello.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nNot tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for\r\ndrinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO, they are our friends; but one cup: I\u2019ll drink for you.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too,\r\nand behold, what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the\r\ninfirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat, man! \u2019Tis a night of revels. The gallants desire it.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWhere are they?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHere at the door. I pray you, call them in.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI\u2019ll do\u2019t; but it dislikes me.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIf I can fasten but one cup upon him,\r\nWith that which he hath drunk tonight already,\r\nHe\u2019ll be as full of quarrel and offence\r\nAs my young mistress\u2019 dog.

From whence ariseth this?\r\nAre we turn\u2019d Turks, and to ourselves do that\r\nWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?\r\nFor Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:\r\nHe that stirs next to carve for his own rage\r\nHolds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.\r\nSilence that dreadful bell, it frights the isle\r\nFrom her propriety. What is the matter, masters?\r\nHonest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,\r\nSpeak, who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI do not know. Friends all but now, even now,\r\nIn quarter, and in terms like bride and groom\r\nDevesting them for bed; and then, but now,\r\nAs if some planet had unwitted men,\r\nSwords out, and tilting one at other\u2019s breast,\r\nIn opposition bloody. I cannot speak\r\nAny beginning to this peevish odds;\r\nAnd would in action glorious I had lost\r\nThose legs that brought me to a part of it!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHow comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWorthy Montano, you were wont be civil.\r\nThe gravity and stillness of your youth\r\nThe world hath noted, and your name is great\r\nIn mouths of wisest censure: what\u2019s the matter,\r\nThat you unlace your reputation thus,\r\nAnd spend your rich opinion for the name\r\nOf a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nWorthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.\r\nYour officer, Iago, can inform you,\r\nWhile I spare speech, which something now offends me,\r\nOf all that I do know; nor know I aught\r\nBy me that\u2019s said or done amiss this night,\r\nUnless self-charity be sometimes a vice,\r\nAnd to defend ourselves it be a sin\r\nWhen violence assails us.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNow, by heaven,\r\nMy blood begins my safer guides to rule,\r\nAnd passion, having my best judgement collied,\r\nAssays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,\r\nOr do but lift this arm, the best of you\r\nShall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know\r\nHow this foul rout began, who set it on,\r\nAnd he that is approv\u2019d in this offence,\r\nThough he had twinn\u2019d with me, both at a birth,\r\nShall lose me. What! in a town of war,\r\nYet wild, the people\u2019s hearts brimful of fear,\r\nTo manage private and domestic quarrel,\r\nIn night, and on the court and guard of safety?\r\n\u2019Tis monstrous. Iago, who began\u2019t?\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nIf partially affin\u2019d, or leagu\u2019d in office,\r\nThou dost deliver more or less than truth,\r\nThou art no soldier.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nTouch me not so near.\r\nI had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth\r\nThan it should do offence to Michael Cassio.\r\nYet I persuade myself, to speak the truth\r\nShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:\r\nMontano and myself being in speech,\r\nThere comes a fellow crying out for help,\r\nAnd Cassio following him with determin\u2019d sword,\r\nTo execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman\r\nSteps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.\r\nMyself the crying fellow did pursue,\r\nLest by his clamour (as it so fell out)\r\nThe town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,\r\nOutran my purpose: and I return\u2019d the rather\r\nFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords,\r\nAnd Cassio high in oath, which till tonight\r\nI ne\u2019er might say before. When I came back,\r\n(For this was brief) I found them close together,\r\nAt blow and thrust, even as again they were\r\nWhen you yourself did part them.\r\nMore of this matter cannot I report.\r\nBut men are men; the best sometimes forget;\r\nThough Cassio did some little wrong to him,\r\nAs men in rage strike those that wish them best,\r\nYet surely Cassio, I believe, receiv\u2019d\r\nFrom him that fled some strange indignity,\r\nWhich patience could not pass.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI know, Iago,\r\nThy honesty and love doth mince this matter,\r\nMaking it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,\r\nBut never more be officer of mine.\r\n\r\n Enter Desdemona, attended.\r\n\r\nLook, if my gentle love be not rais\u2019d up!\r\nI\u2019ll make thee an example.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhat\u2019s the matter?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAll\u2019s well now, sweeting; come away to bed.\r\nSir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.\r\nLead him off.\r\n\r\n [_Montano is led off._]\r\n\r\nIago, look with care about the town,\r\nAnd silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.\r\nCome, Desdemona: \u2019tis the soldiers\u2019 life\r\nTo have their balmy slumbers wak\u2019d with strife.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat, are you hurt, lieutenant?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAy, past all surgery.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMarry, Heaven forbid!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nReputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I\r\nhave lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My\r\nreputation, Iago, my reputation!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAs I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound;\r\nthere is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle\r\nand most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without\r\ndeserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute\r\nyourself such a loser. What, man, there are ways to recover the general\r\nagain: you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy\r\nthan in malice, even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to\r\naffright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he\u2019s yours.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander\r\nwith so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and\r\nspeak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with\r\none\u2019s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name\r\nto be known by, let us call thee devil!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI know not.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIs\u2019t possible?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but\r\nnothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths\r\nto steal away their brains! That we should with joy, pleasance, revel,\r\nand applause, transform ourselves into beasts!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, but you are now well enough: how came you thus recovered?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nIt hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath.\r\nOne unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCome, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the\r\ncondition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not\r\nbefallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard!\r\nHad I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To\r\nbe now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O\r\nstrange! Every inordinate cup is unbless\u2019d, and the ingredient is a\r\ndevil.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCome, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.\r\nExclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I\r\nlove you.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI have well approved it, sir.\u2014I drunk!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. I\u2019ll tell you what\r\nyou shall do. Our general\u2019s wife is now the general; I may say so in\r\nthis respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the\r\ncontemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess\r\nyourself freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your place\r\nagain. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,\r\nshe holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is\r\nrequested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to\r\nsplinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of\r\nyour love shall grow stronger than it was before.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nYou advise me well.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the\r\nvirtuous Desdemona to undertake for me; I am desperate of my fortunes\r\nif they check me here.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nGood night, honest Iago.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd what\u2019s he then, that says I play the villain?\r\nWhen this advice is free I give and honest,\r\nProbal to thinking, and indeed the course\r\nTo win the Moor again? For \u2019tis most easy\r\nThe inclining Desdemona to subdue\r\nIn any honest suit. She\u2019s fram\u2019d as fruitful\r\nAs the free elements. And then for her\r\nTo win the Moor, were\u2019t to renounce his baptism,\r\nAll seals and symbols of redeemed sin,\r\nHis soul is so enfetter\u2019d to her love\r\nThat she may make, unmake, do what she list,\r\nEven as her appetite shall play the god\r\nWith his weak function. How am I then, a villain\r\nTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course,\r\nDirectly to his good? Divinity of hell!\r\nWhen devils will the blackest sins put on,\r\nThey do suggest at first with heavenly shows,\r\nAs I do now: for whiles this honest fool\r\nPlies Desdemona to repair his fortune,\r\nAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,\r\nI\u2019ll pour this pestilence into his ear,\r\nThat she repeals him for her body\u2019s lust;\r\nAnd by how much she strives to do him good,\r\nShe shall undo her credit with the Moor.\r\nSo will I turn her virtue into pitch,\r\nAnd out of her own goodness make the net\r\nThat shall enmesh them all.\r\n\r\n Enter Roderigo.\r\n\r\nHow now, Roderigo?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one\r\nthat fills up the cry. My money is almost spent, I have been tonight\r\nexceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall have\r\nso much experience for my pains, and so, with no money at all and a\r\nlittle more wit, return again to Venice.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHow poor are they that have not patience!\r\nWhat wound did ever heal but by degrees?\r\nThou know\u2019st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft,\r\nAnd wit depends on dilatory time.\r\nDoes\u2019t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,\r\nAnd thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier\u2019d Cassio;\r\nThough other things grow fair against the sun,\r\nYet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.\r\nContent thyself awhile. By the mass, \u2019tis morning;\r\nPleasure and action make the hours seem short.\r\nRetire thee; go where thou art billeted.\r\nAway, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter.\r\nNay, get thee gone.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Roderigo._]\r\n\r\nTwo things are to be done,\r\nMy wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.\r\nI\u2019ll set her on;\r\nMyself the while to draw the Moor apart,\r\nAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio find\r\nSoliciting his wife. Ay, that\u2019s the way.\r\nDull not device by coldness and delay.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT III.\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Cyprus. Before the Castle.\r\n\r\n Enter Cassio and some Musicians.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMasters, play here, I will content your pains,\r\nSomething that\u2019s brief; and bid \u201cGood morrow, general.\u201d\r\n\r\n [_Music._]\r\n\r\n Enter Clown.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhy, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i\u2019\r\nthe nose thus?\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nHow, sir, how?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAre these, I pray you, wind instruments?\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nAy, marry, are they, sir.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nO, thereby hangs a tail.\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nWhereby hangs a tale, sir?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMarry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, masters, here\u2019s\r\nmoney for you: and the general so likes your music, that he desires\r\nyou, for love\u2019s sake, to make no more noise with it.\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nWell, sir, we will not.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nIf you have any music that may not be heard, to\u2019t again. But, as they\r\nsay, to hear music the general does not greatly care.\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nWe have none such, sir.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThen put up your pipes in your bag, for I\u2019ll away. Go, vanish into air,\r\naway!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Musicians._]\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nDost thou hear, mine honest friend?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo, I hear not your honest friend. I hear you.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nPrithee, keep up thy quillets. There\u2019s a poor piece of gold for thee:\r\nif the gentlewoman that attends the general\u2019s wife be stirring, tell\r\nher there\u2019s one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech. Wilt\r\nthou do this?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nShe is stirring, sir; if she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify\r\nunto her.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nDo, good my friend.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Clown._]\r\n\r\n Enter Iago.\r\n\r\nIn happy time, Iago.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou have not been a-bed, then?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWhy, no. The day had broke\r\nBefore we parted. I have made bold, Iago,\r\nTo send in to your wife. My suit to her\r\nIs, that she will to virtuous Desdemona\r\nProcure me some access.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI\u2019ll send her to you presently,\r\nAnd I\u2019ll devise a mean to draw the Moor\r\nOut of the way, that your converse and business\r\nMay be more free.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI humbly thank you for\u2019t.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Iago._]\r\n\r\nI never knew\r\nA Florentine more kind and honest.\r\n\r\n Enter Emilia.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nGood morrow, good lieutenant; I am sorry\r\nFor your displeasure, but all will sure be well.\r\nThe general and his wife are talking of it,\r\nAnd she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies\r\nThat he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus\r\nAnd great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom\r\nHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you\r\nAnd needs no other suitor but his likings\r\nTo take the safest occasion by the front\r\nTo bring you in again.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nYet, I beseech you,\r\nIf you think fit, or that it may be done,\r\nGive me advantage of some brief discourse\r\nWith Desdemona alone.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nPray you, come in.\r\nI will bestow you where you shall have time\r\nTo speak your bosom freely.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI am much bound to you.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Cyprus. A Room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n Enter Othello, Iago and Gentlemen.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThese letters give, Iago, to the pilot,\r\nAnd by him do my duties to the senate.\r\nThat done, I will be walking on the works,\r\nRepair there to me.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWell, my good lord, I\u2019ll do\u2019t.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThis fortification, gentlemen, shall we see\u2019t?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN.\r\nWe\u2019ll wait upon your lordship.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Cyprus. The Garden of the Castle.\r\n\r\n Enter Desdemona, Cassio and Emilia.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nBe thou assured, good Cassio, I will do\r\nAll my abilities in thy behalf.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nGood madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband\r\nAs if the cause were his.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nO, that\u2019s an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,\r\nBut I will have my lord and you again\r\nAs friendly as you were.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nBounteous madam,\r\nWhatever shall become of Michael Cassio,\r\nHe\u2019s never anything but your true servant.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI know\u2019t. I thank you. You do love my lord.\r\nYou have known him long; and be you well assur\u2019d\r\nHe shall in strangeness stand no farther off\r\nThan in a politic distance.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAy, but, lady,\r\nThat policy may either last so long,\r\nOr feed upon such nice and waterish diet,\r\nOr breed itself so out of circumstance,\r\nThat, I being absent, and my place supplied,\r\nMy general will forget my love and service.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nDo not doubt that. Before Emilia here\r\nI give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,\r\nIf I do vow a friendship, I\u2019ll perform it\r\nTo the last article. My lord shall never rest,\r\nI\u2019ll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience;\r\nHis bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;\r\nI\u2019ll intermingle everything he does\r\nWith Cassio\u2019s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,\r\nFor thy solicitor shall rather die\r\nThan give thy cause away.\r\n\r\n Enter Othello and Iago.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nMadam, here comes my lord.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMadam, I\u2019ll take my leave.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy, stay, and hear me speak.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMadam, not now. I am very ill at ease,\r\nUnfit for mine own purposes.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWell, do your discretion.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Cassio._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHa, I like not that.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat dost thou say?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNothing, my lord; or if\u2014I know not what.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWas not that Cassio parted from my wife?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it,\r\nThat he would steal away so guilty-like,\r\nSeeing you coming.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI do believe \u2019twas he.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHow now, my lord?\r\nI have been talking with a suitor here,\r\nA man that languishes in your displeasure.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWho is\u2019t you mean?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,\r\nIf I have any grace or power to move you,\r\nHis present reconciliation take;\r\nFor if he be not one that truly loves you,\r\nThat errs in ignorance and not in cunning,\r\nI have no judgement in an honest face.\r\nI prithee call him back.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWent he hence now?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAy, sooth; so humbled\r\nThat he hath left part of his grief with me\r\nTo suffer with him. Good love, call him back.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNot now, sweet Desdemon, some other time.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nBut shall\u2019t be shortly?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe sooner, sweet, for you.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nShall\u2019t be tonight at supper?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNo, not tonight.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nTomorrow dinner then?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI shall not dine at home;\r\nI meet the captains at the citadel.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,\r\nOn Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn.\r\nI prithee name the time, but let it not\r\nExceed three days. In faith, he\u2019s penitent;\r\nAnd yet his trespass, in our common reason,\r\n(Save that, they say, the wars must make examples\r\nOut of their best) is not almost a fault\r\nTo incur a private check. When shall he come?\r\nTell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,\r\nWhat you would ask me, that I should deny,\r\nOr stand so mammering on. What? Michael Cassio,\r\nThat came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,\r\nWhen I have spoke of you dispraisingly,\r\nHath ta\u2019en your part, to have so much to do\r\nTo bring him in! Trust me, I could do much.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nPrithee no more. Let him come when he will;\r\nI will deny thee nothing.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy, this is not a boon;\r\n\u2019Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,\r\nOr feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\r\nOr sue to you to do a peculiar profit\r\nTo your own person: nay, when I have a suit\r\nWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,\r\nIt shall be full of poise and difficult weight,\r\nAnd fearful to be granted.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI will deny thee nothing.\r\nWhereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,\r\nTo leave me but a little to myself.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nShall I deny you? No, farewell, my lord.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nFarewell, my Desdemona. I\u2019ll come to thee straight.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nEmilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you.\r\nWhate\u2019er you be, I am obedient.\r\n\r\n [_Exit with Emilia._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nExcellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,\r\nBut I do love thee! And when I love thee not,\r\nChaos is come again.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy noble lord,\u2014\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat dost thou say, Iago?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDid Michael Cassio, when you woo\u2019d my lady,\r\nKnow of your love?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHe did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBut for a satisfaction of my thought.\r\nNo further harm.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhy of thy thought, Iago?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI did not think he had been acquainted with her.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO yes, and went between us very oft.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIndeed?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIndeed? Ay, indeed. Discern\u2019st thou aught in that?\r\nIs he not honest?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHonest, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHonest? ay, honest.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy lord, for aught I know.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat dost thou think?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThink, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThink, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,\r\nAs if there were some monster in his thought\r\nToo hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.\r\nI heard thee say even now, thou lik\u2019st not that,\r\nWhen Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?\r\nAnd when I told thee he was of my counsel\r\nIn my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, \u201cIndeed?\u201d\r\nAnd didst contract and purse thy brow together,\r\nAs if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain\r\nSome horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,\r\nShow me thy thought.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy lord, you know I love you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI think thou dost;\r\nAnd for I know thou\u2019rt full of love and honesty\r\nAnd weigh\u2019st thy words before thou giv\u2019st them breath,\r\nTherefore these stops of thine fright me the more:\r\nFor such things in a false disloyal knave\r\nAre tricks of custom; but in a man that\u2019s just,\r\nThey\u2019re close dilations, working from the heart,\r\nThat passion cannot rule.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nFor Michael Cassio,\r\nI dare be sworn I think that he is honest.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI think so too.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMen should be what they seem;\r\nOr those that be not, would they might seem none!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nCertain, men should be what they seem.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy then, I think Cassio\u2019s an honest man.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNay, yet there\u2019s more in this:\r\nI prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,\r\nAs thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts\r\nThe worst of words.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nGood my lord, pardon me.\r\nThough I am bound to every act of duty,\r\nI am not bound to that all slaves are free to.\r\nUtter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false:\r\nAs where\u2019s that palace whereinto foul things\r\nSometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure\r\nBut some uncleanly apprehensions\r\nKeep leets and law-days, and in session sit\r\nWith meditations lawful?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,\r\nIf thou but think\u2019st him wrong\u2019d and mak\u2019st his ear\r\nA stranger to thy thoughts.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI do beseech you,\r\nThough I perchance am vicious in my guess,\r\nAs, I confess, it is my nature\u2019s plague\r\nTo spy into abuses, and of my jealousy\r\nShapes faults that are not,\u2014that your wisdom\r\nFrom one that so imperfectly conceits,\r\nWould take no notice; nor build yourself a trouble\r\nOut of his scattering and unsure observance.\r\nIt were not for your quiet nor your good,\r\nNor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,\r\nTo let you know my thoughts.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat dost thou mean?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nGood name in man and woman, dear my lord,\r\nIs the immediate jewel of their souls.\r\nWho steals my purse steals trash. \u2019Tis something, nothing;\r\n\u2019Twas mine, \u2019tis his, and has been slave to thousands.\r\nBut he that filches from me my good name\r\nRobs me of that which not enriches him\r\nAnd makes me poor indeed.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBy heaven, I\u2019ll know thy thoughts.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou cannot, if my heart were in your hand,\r\nNor shall not, whilst \u2019tis in my custody.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHa?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO, beware, my lord, of jealousy;\r\nIt is the green-ey\u2019d monster which doth mock\r\nThe meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss\r\nWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;\r\nBut O, what damned minutes tells he o\u2019er\r\nWho dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO misery!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nPoor and content is rich, and rich enough;\r\nBut riches fineless is as poor as winter\r\nTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.\r\nGood heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend\r\nFrom jealousy!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhy, why is this?\r\nThink\u2019st thou I\u2019d make a life of jealousy,\r\nTo follow still the changes of the moon\r\nWith fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt\r\nIs once to be resolv\u2019d: exchange me for a goat\r\nWhen I shall turn the business of my soul\r\nTo such exsufflicate and blown surmises,\r\nMatching thy inference. \u2019Tis not to make me jealous,\r\nTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,\r\nIs free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;\r\nWhere virtue is, these are more virtuous:\r\nNor from mine own weak merits will I draw\r\nThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,\r\nFor she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,\r\nI\u2019ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;\r\nAnd on the proof, there is no more but this:\r\nAway at once with love or jealousy!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am glad of it, for now I shall have reason\r\nTo show the love and duty that I bear you\r\nWith franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,\r\nReceive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.\r\nLook to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;\r\nWear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.\r\nI would not have your free and noble nature,\r\nOut of self-bounty, be abus\u2019d. Look to\u2019t.\r\nI know our country disposition well;\r\nIn Venice they do let heaven see the pranks\r\nThey dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience\r\nIs not to leave undone, but keep unknown.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDost thou say so?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nShe did deceive her father, marrying you;\r\nAnd when she seem\u2019d to shake and fear your looks,\r\nShe loved them most.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAnd so she did.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, go to then.\r\nShe that so young could give out such a seeming,\r\nTo seal her father\u2019s eyes up close as oak,\r\nHe thought \u2019twas witchcraft. But I am much to blame.\r\nI humbly do beseech you of your pardon\r\nFor too much loving you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI am bound to thee for ever.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI see this hath a little dash\u2019d your spirits.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNot a jot, not a jot.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nTrust me, I fear it has.\r\nI hope you will consider what is spoke\r\nComes from my love. But I do see you\u2019re mov\u2019d.\r\nI am to pray you not to strain my speech\r\nTo grosser issues nor to larger reach\r\nThan to suspicion.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI will not.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nShould you do so, my lord,\r\nMy speech should fall into such vile success\r\nWhich my thoughts aim\u2019d not. Cassio\u2019s my worthy friend.\r\nMy lord, I see you\u2019re mov\u2019d.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNo, not much mov\u2019d.\r\nI do not think but Desdemona\u2019s honest.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nLong live she so! And long live you to think so!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAnd yet, how nature erring from itself\u2014\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAy, there\u2019s the point. As, to be bold with you,\r\nNot to affect many proposed matches,\r\nOf her own clime, complexion, and degree,\r\nWhereto we see in all things nature tends;\r\nFoh! One may smell in such a will most rank,\r\nFoul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.\r\nBut pardon me: I do not in position\r\nDistinctly speak of her, though I may fear\r\nHer will, recoiling to her better judgement,\r\nMay fall to match you with her country forms,\r\nAnd happily repent.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nFarewell, farewell:\r\nIf more thou dost perceive, let me know more;\r\nSet on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n[_Going._] My lord, I take my leave.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhy did I marry? This honest creature doubtless\r\nSees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n[_Returning._] My lord, I would I might entreat your honour\r\nTo scan this thing no further. Leave it to time:\r\nThough it be fit that Cassio have his place,\r\nFor sure he fills it up with great ability,\r\nYet if you please to hold him off awhile,\r\nYou shall by that perceive him and his means.\r\nNote if your lady strain his entertainment\r\nWith any strong or vehement importunity,\r\nMuch will be seen in that. In the meantime,\r\nLet me be thought too busy in my fears\r\n(As worthy cause I have to fear I am)\r\nAnd hold her free, I do beseech your honour.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nFear not my government.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI once more take my leave.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThis fellow\u2019s of exceeding honesty,\r\nAnd knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,\r\nOf human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,\r\nThough that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,\r\nI\u2019d whistle her off, and let her down the wind\r\nTo prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,\r\nAnd have not those soft parts of conversation\r\nThat chamberers have, or for I am declin\u2019d\r\nInto the vale of years,\u2014yet that\u2019s not much\u2014\r\nShe\u2019s gone, I am abus\u2019d, and my relief\r\nMust be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,\r\nThat we can call these delicate creatures ours,\r\nAnd not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,\r\nAnd live upon the vapour of a dungeon,\r\nThan keep a corner in the thing I love\r\nFor others\u2019 uses. Yet, \u2019tis the plague of great ones,\r\nPrerogativ\u2019d are they less than the base,\r\n\u2019Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:\r\nEven then this forked plague is fated to us\r\nWhen we do quicken. Desdemona comes.\r\nIf she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!\r\nI\u2019ll not believe\u2019t.\r\n\r\n Enter Desdemona and Emilia.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHow now, my dear Othello?\r\nYour dinner, and the generous islanders\r\nBy you invited, do attend your presence.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI am to blame.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy do you speak so faintly?\r\nAre you not well?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI have a pain upon my forehead here.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nFaith, that\u2019s with watching, \u2019twill away again;\r\nLet me but bind it hard, within this hour\r\nIt will be well.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nYour napkin is too little;\r\n\r\n [_He puts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it._]\r\n\r\nLet it alone. Come, I\u2019ll go in with you.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI am very sorry that you are not well.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Othello and Desdemona._]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI am glad I have found this napkin;\r\nThis was her first remembrance from the Moor.\r\nMy wayward husband hath a hundred times\r\nWoo\u2019d me to steal it. But she so loves the token,\r\nFor he conjur\u2019d her she should ever keep it,\r\nThat she reserves it evermore about her\r\nTo kiss and talk to. I\u2019ll have the work ta\u2019en out,\r\nAnd give\u2019t Iago. What he will do with it\r\nHeaven knows, not I,\r\nI nothing but to please his fantasy.\r\n\r\n Enter Iago.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHow now? What do you here alone?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nDo not you chide. I have a thing for you.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nA thing for me? It is a common thing\u2014\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHa?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nTo have a foolish wife.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO, is that all? What will you give me now\r\nFor that same handkerchief?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat handkerchief?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWhat handkerchief?\r\nWhy, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,\r\nThat which so often you did bid me steal.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHast stol\u2019n it from her?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nNo, faith, she let it drop by negligence,\r\nAnd, to the advantage, I being here, took \u2019t up.\r\nLook, here it is.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nA good wench, give it me.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWhat will you do with\u2019t, that you have been so earnest\r\nTo have me filch it?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n[_Snatching it._] Why, what\u2019s that to you?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIf it be not for some purpose of import,\r\nGive \u2019t me again. Poor lady, she\u2019ll run mad\r\nWhen she shall lack it.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBe not acknown on\u2019t, I have use for it.\r\nGo, leave me.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Emilia._]\r\n\r\nI will in Cassio\u2019s lodging lose this napkin,\r\nAnd let him find it. Trifles light as air\r\nAre to the jealous confirmations strong\r\nAs proofs of holy writ. This may do something.\r\nThe Moor already changes with my poison:\r\nDangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,\r\nWhich at the first are scarce found to distaste,\r\nBut with a little act upon the blood\r\nBurn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.\r\n\r\n Enter Othello.\r\n\r\nLook, where he comes. Not poppy, nor mandragora,\r\nNor all the drowsy syrups of the world,\r\nShall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\r\nWhich thou ow\u2019dst yesterday.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHa! ha! false to me?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, how now, general? No more of that.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAvaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.\r\nI swear \u2019tis better to be much abus\u2019d\r\nThan but to know\u2019t a little.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHow now, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat sense had I of her stol\u2019n hours of lust?\r\nI saw\u2019t not, thought it not, it harm\u2019d not me.\r\nI slept the next night well, was free and merry;\r\nI found not Cassio\u2019s kisses on her lips.\r\nHe that is robb\u2019d, not wanting what is stol\u2019n,\r\nLet him not know\u2019t, and he\u2019s not robb\u2019d at all.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am sorry to hear this.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI had been happy if the general camp,\r\nPioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,\r\nSo I had nothing known. O, now, for ever\r\nFarewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!\r\nFarewell the plumed troops and the big wars\r\nThat make ambition virtue! O, farewell,\r\nFarewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,\r\nThe spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,\r\nThe royal banner, and all quality,\r\nPride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!\r\nAnd, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats\r\nThe immortal Jove\u2019s dread clamours counterfeit,\r\nFarewell! Othello\u2019s occupation\u2019s gone!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIs\u2019t possible, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nVillain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;\r\nBe sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,\r\nOr, by the worth of man\u2019s eternal soul,\r\nThou hadst been better have been born a dog\r\nThan answer my wak\u2019d wrath.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIs\u2019t come to this?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nMake me to see\u2019t, or at the least so prove it,\r\nThat the probation bear no hinge nor loop\r\nTo hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy noble lord,\u2014\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIf thou dost slander her and torture me,\r\nNever pray more. Abandon all remorse;\r\nOn horror\u2019s head horrors accumulate;\r\nDo deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz\u2019d;\r\nFor nothing canst thou to damnation add\r\nGreater than that.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO grace! O heaven defend me!\r\nAre you a man? Have you a soul or sense?\r\nGod be wi\u2019 you. Take mine office.\u2014O wretched fool,\r\nThat liv\u2019st to make thine honesty a vice!\r\nO monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,\r\nTo be direct and honest is not safe.\r\nI thank you for this profit, and from hence\r\nI\u2019ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI should be wise; for honesty\u2019s a fool,\r\nAnd loses that it works for.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBy the world,\r\nI think my wife be honest, and think she is not.\r\nI think that thou art just, and think thou art not.\r\nI\u2019ll have some proof: her name, that was as fresh\r\nAs Dian\u2019s visage, is now begrim\u2019d and black\r\nAs mine own face. If there be cords or knives,\r\nPoison or fire, or suffocating streams,\r\nI\u2019ll not endure \u2019t. Would I were satisfied!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.\r\nI do repent me that I put it to you.\r\nYou would be satisfied?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWould? Nay, I will.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?\r\nWould you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,\r\nBehold her topp\u2019d?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDeath and damnation! O!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIt were a tedious difficulty, I think,\r\nTo bring them to that prospect. Damn them then,\r\nIf ever mortal eyes do see them bolster\r\nMore than their own! What then? How then?\r\nWhat shall I say? Where\u2019s satisfaction?\r\nIt is impossible you should see this,\r\nWere they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,\r\nAs salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross\r\nAs ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,\r\nIf imputation and strong circumstances,\r\nWhich lead directly to the door of truth,\r\nWill give you satisfaction, you may have\u2019t.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nGive me a living reason she\u2019s disloyal.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI do not like the office,\r\nBut sith I am enter\u2019d in this cause so far,\r\nPrick\u2019d to \u2019t by foolish honesty and love,\r\nI will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,\r\nAnd being troubled with a raging tooth,\r\nI could not sleep.\r\nThere are a kind of men so loose of soul,\r\nThat in their sleeps will mutter their affairs.\r\nOne of this kind is Cassio:\r\nIn sleep I heard him say, \u201cSweet Desdemona,\r\nLet us be wary, let us hide our loves;\u201d\r\nAnd then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,\r\nCry \u201cO sweet creature!\u201d and then kiss me hard,\r\nAs if he pluck\u2019d up kisses by the roots,\r\nThat grew upon my lips, then laid his leg\r\nOver my thigh, and sigh\u2019d and kiss\u2019d, and then\r\nCried \u201cCursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!\u201d\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO monstrous! monstrous!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNay, this was but his dream.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBut this denoted a foregone conclusion.\r\n\u2019Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd this may help to thicken other proofs\r\nThat do demonstrate thinly.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI\u2019ll tear her all to pieces.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done,\r\nShe may be honest yet. Tell me but this,\r\nHave you not sometimes seen a handkerchief\r\nSpotted with strawberries in your wife\u2019s hand?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI gave her such a one, \u2019twas my first gift.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI know not that: but such a handkerchief\r\n(I am sure it was your wife\u2019s) did I today\r\nSee Cassio wipe his beard with.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIf it be that,\u2014\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIf it be that, or any that was hers,\r\nIt speaks against her with the other proofs.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO, that the slave had forty thousand lives!\r\nOne is too poor, too weak for my revenge!\r\nNow do I see \u2019tis true. Look here, Iago;\r\nAll my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.\r\n\u2019Tis gone.\r\nArise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!\r\nYield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne\r\nTo tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,\r\nFor \u2019tis of aspics\u2019 tongues!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYet be content.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO, blood, Iago, blood!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nPatience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNever, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,\r\nWhose icy current and compulsive course\r\nNe\u2019er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on\r\nTo the Propontic and the Hellespont;\r\nEven so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace\r\nShall ne\u2019er look back, ne\u2019er ebb to humble love,\r\nTill that a capable and wide revenge\r\nSwallow them up. Now by yond marble heaven,\r\nIn the due reverence of a sacred vow [_Kneels._]\r\nI here engage my words.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDo not rise yet. [_Kneels._]\r\nWitness, you ever-burning lights above,\r\nYou elements that clip us round about,\r\nWitness that here Iago doth give up\r\nThe execution of his wit, hands, heart,\r\nTo wrong\u2019d Othello\u2019s service! Let him command,\r\nAnd to obey shall be in me remorse,\r\nWhat bloody business ever.\r\n\r\n [_They rise._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI greet thy love,\r\nNot with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,\r\nAnd will upon the instant put thee to \u2019t.\r\nWithin these three days let me hear thee say\r\nThat Cassio\u2019s not alive.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy friend is dead. \u2019Tis done at your request.\r\nBut let her live.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDamn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn her!\r\nCome, go with me apart, I will withdraw\r\nTo furnish me with some swift means of death\r\nFor the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am your own for ever.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Cyprus. Before the Castle.\r\n\r\n Enter Desdemona, Emilia and Clown.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nDo you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI dare not say he lies anywhere.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy, man?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHe\u2019s a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nGo to. Where lodges he?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTo tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nCan anything be made of this?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI know not where he lodges; and for me to devise a lodging, and say he\r\nlies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nCan you inquire him out, and be edified by report?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions and by them\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nSeek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my lord on his\r\nbehalf, and hope all will be well.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTo do this is within the compass of man\u2019s wit, and therefore I will\r\nattempt the doing it.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhere should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI know not, madam.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nBelieve me, I had rather have lost my purse\r\nFull of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor\r\nIs true of mind and made of no such baseness\r\nAs jealous creatures are, it were enough\r\nTo put him to ill thinking.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIs he not jealous?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWho, he? I think the sun where he was born\r\nDrew all such humours from him.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nLook, where he comes.\r\n\r\n Enter Othello.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI will not leave him now till Cassio\r\nBe call\u2019d to him. How is\u2019t with you, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWell, my good lady. [_Aside._] O, hardness to dissemble!\r\nHow do you, Desdemona?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWell, my good lord.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nGive me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIt yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThis argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.\r\nHot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires\r\nA sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,\r\nMuch castigation, exercise devout;\r\nFor here\u2019s a young and sweating devil here\r\nThat commonly rebels. \u2019Tis a good hand,\r\nA frank one.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nYou may indeed say so,\r\nFor \u2019twas that hand that gave away my heart.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nA liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands,\r\nBut our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat promise, chuck?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.\r\nLend me thy handkerchief.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHere, my lord.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThat which I gave you.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI have it not about me.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNot?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nNo, faith, my lord.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThat is a fault. That handkerchief\r\nDid an Egyptian to my mother give.\r\nShe was a charmer, and could almost read\r\nThe thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,\r\n\u2019Twould make her amiable and subdue my father\r\nEntirely to her love. But if she lost it,\r\nOr made a gift of it, my father\u2019s eye\r\nShould hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt\r\nAfter new fancies: she, dying, gave it me,\r\nAnd bid me, when my fate would have me wive,\r\nTo give it her. I did so; and take heed on\u2019t,\r\nMake it a darling like your precious eye.\r\nTo lose\u2019t or give\u2019t away were such perdition\r\nAs nothing else could match.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIs\u2019t possible?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n\u2019Tis true. There\u2019s magic in the web of it.\r\nA sibyl, that had number\u2019d in the world\r\nThe sun to course two hundred compasses,\r\nIn her prophetic fury sew\u2019d the work;\r\nThe worms were hallow\u2019d that did breed the silk,\r\nAnd it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful\r\nConserv\u2019d of maiden\u2019s hearts.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIndeed? Is\u2019t true?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nMost veritable, therefore look to \u2019t well.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nThen would to God that I had never seen \u2019t!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHa? wherefore?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy do you speak so startingly and rash?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIs\u2019t lost? is\u2019t gone? speak, is it out of the way?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHeaven bless us!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nSay you?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIt is not lost, but what and if it were?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI say it is not lost.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nFetch\u2019t, let me see \u2019t.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy, so I can, sir, but I will not now.\r\nThis is a trick to put me from my suit.\r\nPray you, let Cassio be receiv\u2019d again.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nFetch me the handkerchief! My mind misgives.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nCome, come.\r\nYou\u2019ll never meet a more sufficient man.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe handkerchief!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI pray, talk me of Cassio.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe handkerchief!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nA man that all his time\r\nHath founded his good fortunes on your love,\r\nShar\u2019d dangers with you,\u2014\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe handkerchief!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIn sooth, you are to blame.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAway!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIs not this man jealous?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI ne\u2019er saw this before.\r\nSure there\u2019s some wonder in this handkerchief,\r\nI am most unhappy in the loss of it.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\n\u2019Tis not a year or two shows us a man:\r\nThey are all but stomachs and we all but food;\r\nThey eat us hungerly, and when they are full,\r\nThey belch us.\r\n\r\n Enter Cassio and Iago.\r\n\r\nLook you, Cassio and my husband.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThere is no other way; \u2019tis she must do \u2019t,\r\nAnd, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHow now, good Cassio, what\u2019s the news with you?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMadam, my former suit: I do beseech you\r\nThat by your virtuous means I may again\r\nExist, and be a member of his love,\r\nWhom I, with all the office of my heart,\r\nEntirely honour. I would not be delay\u2019d.\r\nIf my offence be of such mortal kind\r\nThat nor my service past, nor present sorrows,\r\nNor purpos\u2019d merit in futurity,\r\nCan ransom me into his love again,\r\nBut to know so must be my benefit;\r\nSo shall I clothe me in a forc\u2019d content,\r\nAnd shut myself up in some other course\r\nTo fortune\u2019s alms.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAlas, thrice-gentle Cassio,\r\nMy advocation is not now in tune;\r\nMy lord is not my lord; nor should I know him\r\nWere he in favour as in humour alter\u2019d.\r\nSo help me every spirit sanctified,\r\nAs I have spoken for you all my best,\r\nAnd stood within the blank of his displeasure\r\nFor my free speech! You must awhile be patient.\r\nWhat I can do I will; and more I will\r\nThan for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIs my lord angry?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHe went hence but now,\r\nAnd certainly in strange unquietness.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCan he be angry? I have seen the cannon,\r\nWhen it hath blown his ranks into the air\r\nAnd, like the devil, from his very arm\r\nPuff\u2019d his own brother, and can he be angry?\r\nSomething of moment then. I will go meet him.\r\nThere\u2019s matter in\u2019t indeed if he be angry.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI prithee do so.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Iago._]\r\n\r\nSomething sure of state,\r\nEither from Venice, or some unhatch\u2019d practice\r\nMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,\r\nHath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases\r\nMen\u2019s natures wrangle with inferior things,\r\nThough great ones are their object. \u2019Tis even so.\r\nFor let our finger ache, and it indues\r\nOur other healthful members even to that sense\r\nOf pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,\r\nNor of them look for such observancy\r\nAs fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,\r\nI was (unhandsome warrior as I am)\r\nArraigning his unkindness with my soul;\r\nBut now I find I had suborn\u2019d the witness,\r\nAnd he\u2019s indicted falsely.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nPray heaven it be state matters, as you think,\r\nAnd no conception nor no jealous toy\r\nConcerning you.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAlas the day, I never gave him cause!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nBut jealous souls will not be answer\u2019d so;\r\nThey are not ever jealous for the cause,\r\nBut jealous for they are jealous: \u2019tis a monster\r\nBegot upon itself, born on itself.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHeaven keep that monster from Othello\u2019s mind!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nLady, amen.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:\r\nIf I do find him fit, I\u2019ll move your suit,\r\nAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI humbly thank your ladyship.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia._]\r\n\r\n Enter Bianca.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nSave you, friend Cassio!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWhat make you from home?\r\nHow is it with you, my most fair Bianca?\r\nI\u2019 faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nAnd I was going to your lodging, Cassio.\r\nWhat, keep a week away?

Do but encave yourself,\r\nAnd mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,\r\nThat dwell in every region of his face;\r\nFor I will make him tell the tale anew,\r\nWhere, how, how oft, how long ago, and when\r\nHe hath, and is again to cope your wife:\r\nI say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,\r\nOr I shall say you are all in all in spleen,\r\nAnd nothing of a man.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDost thou hear, Iago?\r\nI will be found most cunning in my patience;\r\nBut,\u2014dost thou hear?\u2014most bloody.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThat\u2019s not amiss.\r\nBut yet keep time in all.

Now he begins the story.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nShe was here even now. She haunts me in every place. I was the other\r\nday talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes\r\nthe bauble, and falls thus about my neck.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nCrying, \u201cO dear Cassio!\u201d as it were: his gesture imports it.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nSo hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me. Ha, ha,\r\nha!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNow he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of\r\nyours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWell, I must leave her company.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBefore me! look where she comes.\r\n\r\n Enter Bianca.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\n\u2019Tis such another fitchew! Marry, a perfum\u2019d one.\r\nWhat do you mean by this haunting of me?\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nLet the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same\r\nhandkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must\r\ntake out the work? A likely piece of work, that you should find it in\r\nyour chamber and not know who left it there! This is some minx\u2019s token,\r\nand I must take out the work? There, give it your hobby-horse.\r\nWheresoever you had it, I\u2019ll take out no work on\u2019t.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHow now, my sweet Bianca? How now, how now?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBy heaven, that should be my handkerchief!\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nIf you\u2019ll come to supper tonight, you may.

Go to.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAlas, Iago,\r\nWhat shall I do to win my lord again?\r\nGood friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,\r\nI know not how I lost him. Here I kneel.\r\nIf e\u2019er my will did trespass \u2019gainst his love,\r\nEither in discourse of thought or actual deed,\r\nOr that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,\r\nDelighted them in any other form,\r\nOr that I do not yet, and ever did,\r\nAnd ever will, (though he do shake me off\r\nTo beggarly divorcement) love him dearly,\r\nComfort forswear me!

I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor am\r\nI yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWill you hear me, Roderigo?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nFaith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no\r\nkin together.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou charge me most unjustly.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWith naught but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels\r\nyou have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted\r\na votarist: you have told me she hath received them, and returned me\r\nexpectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I\r\nfind none.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWell, go to, very well.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nVery well, go to, I cannot go to, man, nor \u2019tis not very well. Nay, I\r\nsay \u2019tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nVery well.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI tell you \u2019tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona.\r\nIf she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my\r\nunlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction\r\nof you.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou have said now.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nAy, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, now I see there\u2019s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do\r\nbuild on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand,\r\nRoderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I\r\nprotest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nIt hath not appeared.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without\r\nwit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed,\r\nwhich I have greater reason to believe now than ever,\u2014I mean purpose,\r\ncourage, and valour,\u2014this night show it. If thou the next night\r\nfollowing enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery\r\nand devise engines for my life.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWell, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nSir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in\r\nOthello\u2019s place.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nIs that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair\r\nDesdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein\r\nnone can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nHow do you mean \u201cremoving\u201d of him?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, by making him uncapable of Othello\u2019s place: knocking out his\r\nbrains.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nAnd that you would have me to do?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAy, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with\r\na harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of his\r\nhonourable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which I will\r\nfashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your\r\npleasure: I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall\r\nbetween us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will\r\nshow you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself\r\nbound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows\r\nto waste. About it.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI will hear further reason for this.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd you shall be satisfied.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Cyprus.

Mine eyes do itch;\r\nDoth that bode weeping?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\n\u2019Tis neither here nor there.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!\r\nDost thou in conscience think,\u2014tell me, Emilia,\u2014\r\nThat there be women do abuse their husbands\r\nIn such gross kind?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThere be some such, no question.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWhy, would not you?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nNo, by this heavenly light!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nNor I neither by this heavenly light,\r\nI might do\u2019t as well i\u2019 the dark.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThe world\u2019s a huge thing. It is a great price\r\nFor a small vice.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIn troth, I think thou wouldst not.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIn troth, I think I should, and undo\u2019t when I had done. Marry, I would\r\nnot do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for\r\ngowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for the\r\nwhole world\u2014why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a\r\nmonarch? I should venture purgatory for \u2019t.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nBeshrew me, if I would do such a wrong for the whole world.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWhy, the wrong is but a wrong i\u2019 the world; and having the world for\r\nyour labour, \u2019tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make\r\nit right.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI do not think there is any such woman.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nYes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they\r\nplayed for.\r\nBut I do think it is their husbands\u2019 faults\r\nIf wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,\r\nAnd pour our treasures into foreign laps;\r\nOr else break out in peevish jealousies,\r\nThrowing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,\r\nOr scant our former having in despite.\r\nWhy, we have galls; and though we have some grace,\r\nYet have we some revenge. Let husbands know\r\nTheir wives have sense like them: they see, and smell\r\nAnd have their palates both for sweet and sour,\r\nAs husbands have. What is it that they do\r\nWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?\r\nI think it is. And doth affection breed it?\r\nI think it doth. Is\u2019t frailty that thus errs?\r\nIt is so too. And have not we affections,\r\nDesires for sport, and frailty, as men have?\r\nThen let them use us well: else let them know,\r\nThe ills we do, their ills instruct us so.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nGood night, good night. Heaven me such usage send,\r\nNot to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT V.\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Cyprus.

But so, I hear him coming.\r\n\r\n Enter Cassio.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI know his gait; \u2019tis he.

I would not kill thy soul.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nTalk you of killing?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAy, I do.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nThen heaven have mercy on me!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAmen, with all my heart!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIf you say so, I hope you will not kill me.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHum!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAnd yet I fear you, for you are fatal then\r\nWhen your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,\r\nSince guiltiness I know not, but yet I feel I fear.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThink on thy sins.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nThey are loves I bear to you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAy, and for that thou diest.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nThat death\u2019s unnatural that kills for loving.\r\nAlas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?\r\nSome bloody passion shakes your very frame.\r\nThese are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,\r\nThey do not point on me.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nPeace, and be still!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI will so.

I must needs report the truth.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nShe\u2019s like a liar, gone to burning hell.\r\n\u2019Twas I that kill\u2019d her.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO, the more angel she,\r\nAnd you the blacker devil!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nShe turn\u2019d to folly, and she was a whore.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nShe was false as water.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThou art rash as fire, to say\r\nThat she was false: O, she was heavenly true!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nCassio did top her; ask thy husband else.\r\nO, I were damn\u2019d beneath all depth in hell,\r\nBut that I did proceed upon just grounds\r\nTo this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nMy husband?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThy husband.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThat she was false to wedlock?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAy, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,\r\nIf heaven would make me such another world\r\nOf one entire and perfect chrysolite,\r\nI\u2019d not have sold her for it.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nMy husband?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAy, \u2019twas he that told me first.\r\nAn honest man he is, and hates the slime\r\nThat sticks on filthy deeds.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nMy husband?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat needs this iterance, woman? I say thy husband.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!\r\nMy husband say that she was false?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHe, woman;\r\nI say thy husband: dost understand the word?\r\nMy friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIf he say so, may his pernicious soul\r\nRot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart.\r\nShe was too fond of her most filthy bargain.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nDo thy worst:\r\nThis deed of thine is no more worthy heaven\r\nThan thou wast worthy her.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nPeace, you were best.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThou hast not half that power to do me harm\r\nAs I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!\r\nAs ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed\r\n(I care not for thy sword) I\u2019ll make thee known,\r\nThough I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help!\r\nThe Moor hath kill\u2019d my mistress! Murder, murder!\r\n\r\n Enter Montano, Gratiano and Iago.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nWhat is the matter? How now, general?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO, are you come, Iago? You have done well,\r\nThat men must lay their murders on your neck.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nWhat is the matter?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nDisprove this villain, if thou be\u2019st a man.\r\nHe says thou told\u2019st him that his wife was false.\r\nI know thou didst not, thou\u2019rt not such a villain.\r\nSpeak, for my heart is full.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI told him what I thought, and told no more\r\nThan what he found himself was apt and true.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nBut did you ever tell him she was false?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI did.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nYou told a lie, an odious, damned lie;\r\nUpon my soul, a lie; a wicked lie.\r\nShe false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWith Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.\r\nMy mistress here lies murder\u2019d in her bed.\r\n\r\nALL.\r\nO heavens forfend!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nAnd your reports have set the murder on.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNay, stare not, masters, it is true indeed.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\n\u2019Tis a strange truth.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nO monstrous act!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nVillany, villany, villany!\r\nI think upon\u2019t, I think I smell\u2019t; O villany!\r\nI thought so then. I\u2019ll kill myself for grief.\r\nO villany, villany!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nGood gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.\r\n\u2019Tis proper I obey him, but not now.\r\nPerchance, Iago, I will ne\u2019er go home.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO! O! O!\r\n\r\n [_Hanging over his wife._]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nNay, lay thee down and roar;\r\nFor thou hast kill\u2019d the sweetest innocent\r\nThat e\u2019er did lift up eye.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n[_Rising._] O, she was foul!\r\nI scarce did know you, uncle, there lies your niece,\r\nWhose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp\u2019d.\r\nI know this act shows horrible and grim.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nPoor Desdemona! I am glad thy father\u2019s dead.\r\nThy match was mortal to him, and pure grief\r\nShore his old thread in twain: did he live now,\r\nThis sight would make him do a desperate turn,\r\nYea, curse his better angel from his side,\r\nAnd fall to reprobance.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n\u2019Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows\r\nThat she with Cassio hath the act of shame\r\nA thousand times committed; Cassio confess\u2019d it,\r\nAnd she did gratify his amorous works\r\nWith that recognizance and pledge of love\r\nWhich I first gave her; I saw it in his hand.\r\nIt was a handkerchief, an antique token\r\nMy father gave my mother.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO heaven! O heavenly powers!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCome, hold your peace.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\n\u2019Twill out, \u2019twill out. I peace?\r\nNo, I will speak as liberal as the north.\r\nLet heaven and men and devils, let them all,\r\nAll, all, cry shame against me, yet I\u2019ll speak.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBe wise, and get you home.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI will not.\r\n\r\n [_Iago offers to stab his wife._]\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nFie!\r\nYour sword upon a woman?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak\u2019st of\r\nI found by fortune and did give my husband;\r\nFor often with a solemn earnestness,\r\nMore than indeed belong\u2019d to such a trifle,\r\nHe begg\u2019d of me to steal it.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nVillanous whore!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nShe give it Cassio! no, alas, I found it,\r\nAnd I did give\u2019t my husband.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nFilth, thou liest!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nBy heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.\r\nO murderous coxcomb! What should such a fool\r\nDo with so good a wife?\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHELLO\r\nAre there not stones in heaven\r\nBut what serve for thunder? Precious villain!\r\n\r\n [_Iago stabs Emilia and then runs out._]\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nThe woman falls. Sure, he hath kill\u2019d his wife.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nAy, ay. O, lay me by my mistress\u2019 side.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nHe\u2019s gone, but his wife\u2019s kill\u2019d.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\n\u2019Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,\r\nWhich I have here recover\u2019d from the Moor.\r\nCome, guard the door without, let him not pass,\r\nBut kill him rather. I\u2019ll after that same villain,\r\nFor \u2019tis a damned slave.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Montano and Gratiano._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI am not valiant neither,\r\nBut every puny whipster gets my sword.\r\nBut why should honour outlive honesty?\r\nLet it go all.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWhat did thy song bode, lady?\r\nHark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,\r\nAnd die in music.\r\n[_Sings._] _Willow, willow, willow._\r\nMoor, she was chaste. She lov\u2019d thee, cruel Moor,\r\nSo come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;\r\nSo speaking as I think, I die, I die.\r\n\r\n [_She dies._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI have another weapon in this chamber,\r\nIt is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook\u2019s temper.\r\nO, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\n[_Within._] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;\r\nThou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nLook in upon me then, and speak with me,\r\nOr, naked as I am, I will assault thee.\r\n\r\n Enter Gratiano.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nWhat is the matter?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBehold, I have a weapon.\r\nA better never did itself sustain\r\nUpon a soldier\u2019s thigh: I have seen the day\r\nThat with this little arm and this good sword\r\nI have made my way through more impediments\r\nThan twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!\r\nWho can control his fate? \u2019Tis not so now.\r\nBe not afraid, though you do see me weapon\u2019d.\r\nHere is my journey\u2019s end, here is my butt,\r\nAnd very sea-mark of my utmost sail.\r\nDo you go back dismay\u2019d? \u2019Tis a lost fear.\r\nMan but a rush against Othello\u2019s breast,\r\nAnd he retires. Where should Othello go?\r\nNow, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr\u2019d wench,\r\nPale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,\r\nThis look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,\r\nAnd fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!\r\nEven like thy chastity.\r\nO cursed, cursed slave! Whip me, ye devils,\r\nFrom the possession of this heavenly sight!\r\nBlow me about in winds, roast me in sulphur,\r\nWash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!\r\nO Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! dead! Oh, oh!\r\n\r\n Enter Lodovico, Montano, Cassio carried in a chair, and Officers with\r\n Iago prisoner.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nWhere is this rash and most unfortunate man?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThat\u2019s he that was Othello. Here I am.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nWhere is that viper? Bring the villain forth.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI look down towards his feet; but that\u2019s a fable.\r\nIf that thou be\u2019st a devil, I cannot kill thee.\r\n\r\n [_Wounds Iago._]\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nWrench his sword from him.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI bleed, sir, but not kill\u2019d.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI am not sorry neither. I\u2019d have thee live,\r\nFor in my sense \u2019tis happiness to die.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nO thou Othello, that wert once so good,\r\nFall\u2019n in the practice of a damned slave,\r\nWhat shall be said to thee?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhy, anything;\r\nAn honourable murderer, if you will.\r\nFor naught did I in hate, but all in honour.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nThis wretch hath part confess\u2019d his villany.\r\nDid you and he consent in Cassio\u2019s death?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAy.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nDear general, I never gave you cause.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI do believe it, and I ask your pardon.\r\nWill you, I pray, demand that demi-devil\r\nWhy he hath thus ensnar\u2019d my soul and body?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDemand me nothing. What you know, you know.\r\nFrom this time forth I never will speak word.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nWhat, not to pray?\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nTorments will ope your lips.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWell, thou dost best.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nSir, you shall understand what hath befall\u2019n,\r\nWhich, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter\r\nFound in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,\r\nAnd here another. The one of them imports\r\nThe death of Cassio, to be undertook\r\nBy Roderigo.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO villain!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMost heathenish and most gross!\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nNow here\u2019s another discontented paper,\r\nFound in his pocket too; and this, it seems,\r\nRoderigo meant to have sent this damned villain,\r\nBut that, belike, Iago in the interim\r\nCame in and satisfied him.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO the pernicious caitiff!\r\nHow came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief\r\nThat was my wife\u2019s?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI found it in my chamber.\r\nAnd he himself confess\u2019d but even now,\r\nThat there he dropp\u2019d it for a special purpose\r\nWhich wrought to his desire.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO fool! fool! fool!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThere is besides in Roderigo\u2019s letter,\r\nHow he upbraids Iago, that he made him\r\nBrave me upon the watch, whereon it came\r\nThat I was cast. And even but now he spake,\r\nAfter long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,\r\nIago set him on.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nYou must forsake this room, and go with us.\r\nYour power and your command is taken off,\r\nAnd Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,\r\nIf there be any cunning cruelty\r\nThat can torment him much and hold him long,\r\nIt shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,\r\nTill that the nature of your fault be known\r\nTo the Venetian state. Come, bring away.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nSoft you; a word or two before you go.\r\nI have done the state some service, and they know\u2019t.\r\nNo more of that. I pray you, in your letters,\r\nWhen you shall these unlucky deeds relate,\r\nSpeak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,\r\nNor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak\r\nOf one that loved not wisely, but too well;\r\nOf one not easily jealous, but being wrought,\r\nPerplex\u2019d in the extreme; of one whose hand,\r\nLike the base Judean, threw a pearl away\r\nRicher than all his tribe; of one whose subdu\u2019d eyes,\r\nAlbeit unused to the melting mood,\r\nDrop tears as fast as the Arabian trees\r\nTheir medicinal gum. Set you down this.\r\nAnd say besides, that in Aleppo once,\r\nWhere a malignant and a turban\u2019d Turk\r\nBeat a Venetian and traduc\u2019d the state,\r\nI took by the throat the circumcised dog,\r\nAnd smote him, thus.\r\n\r\n [_Stabs himself._]\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nO bloody period!\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nAll that\u2019s spoke is marr\u2019d.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI kiss\u2019d thee ere I kill\u2019d thee. No way but this,\r\nKilling myself, to die upon a kiss.\r\n\r\n [_Falling upon Desdemona._]\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThis did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,\r\nFor he was great of heart.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\n[_To Iago._] O Spartan dog,\r\nMore fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,\r\nLook on the tragic loading of this bed.\r\nThis is thy work. The object poisons sight,\r\nLet it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,\r\nAnd seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,\r\nFor they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,\r\nRemains the censure of this hellish villain.\r\nThe time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it!\r\nMyself will straight aboard, and to the state\r\nThis heavy act with heavy heart relate.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r"
