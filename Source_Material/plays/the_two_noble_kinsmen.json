To heare him\nSing in an evening, what a heaven it is!\nAnd yet his Songs are sad ones.  Fairer spoken\nWas never Gentleman.  When I come in\nTo bring him water in a morning, first\nHe bowes his noble body, then salutes me, thus:\n'Faire, gentle Mayde, good morrow; may thy goodnes\nGet thee a happy husband.'  Once he kist me.\nI lov'd my lips the better ten daies after.\nWould he would doe so ev'ry day!  He greives much,\nAnd me as much to see his misery.\nWhat should I doe, to make him know I love him?\nFor I would faine enjoy him.  Say I ventur'd\nTo set him free? what saies the law then?  Thus much\nFor Law, or kindred!  I will doe it,\nAnd this night, or to morrow, he shall love me.  [Exit.]\n\nSCENE 5.

Palamon\nHas a most menacing aspect: his brow\nIs grav'd, and seemes to bury what it frownes on;\nYet sometime tis not so, but alters to\nThe quallity of his thoughts; long time his eye\nWill dwell upon his object.  Mellencholly\nBecomes him nobly; So do's Arcites mirth,\nBut Palamons sadnes is a kinde of mirth,\nSo mingled, as if mirth did make him sad,\nAnd sadnes, merry; those darker humours that\nSticke misbecomingly on others, on them\nLive in faire dwelling.  [Cornets.  Trompets sound as to a\ncharge.]\nHarke, how yon spurs to spirit doe incite\nThe Princes to their proofe! Arcite may win me,\nAnd yet may Palamon wound Arcite to\nThe spoyling of his figure.  O, what pitty\nEnough for such a chance; if I were by,\nI might doe hurt, for they would glance their eies\nToward my Seat, and in that motion might\nOmit a ward, or forfeit an offence\nWhich crav'd that very time: it is much better\nI am not there; oh better never borne\nThen minister to such harme.

They are comming off:\nAlas, poore Palamon!

I have heard\nTwo emulous Philomels beate the eare o'th night\nWith their contentious throates, now one the higher,\nAnon the other, then againe the first,\nAnd by and by out breasted, that the sence\nCould not be judge betweene 'em: So it far'd\nGood space betweene these kinesmen; till heavens did\nMake hardly one the winner.

A day or two\nLet us looke sadly, and give grace unto\nThe Funerall of Arcite; in whose end\nThe visages of Bridegroomes weele put on\nAnd smile with Palamon; for whom an houre,\nBut one houre, since, I was as dearely sorry,\nAs glad of Arcite: and am now as glad,\nAs for him sorry.  O you heavenly Charmers,\nWhat things you make of us!  For what we lacke\nWe laugh, for what we have, are sorry: still\nAre children in some kind.  Let us be thankefull\nFor that which is, and with you leave dispute\nThat are above our question.  Let's goe off,\nAnd beare us like the time.  [Florish.

Now what say ye?\nAnd yet mistake me not: I am not bold;\nWe have no such cause.  If the tale we have told\n(For tis no other) any way content ye\n(For to that honest purpose it was ment ye)\nWe have our end; and ye shall have ere long,\nI dare say, many a better, to prolong\nYour old loves to us: we, and all our might\nRest at your service.
