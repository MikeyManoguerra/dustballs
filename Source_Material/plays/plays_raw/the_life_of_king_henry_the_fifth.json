But pardon, gentles all,\nThe flat unraised spirits that hath dar\u2019d\nOn this unworthy scaffold to bring forth\nSo great an object. Can this cockpit hold\nThe vasty fields of France? Or may we cram\nWithin this wooden O the very casques\nThat did affright the air at Agincourt?\nO pardon! since a crooked figure may\nAttest in little place a million,\nAnd let us, ciphers to this great accompt,\nOn your imaginary forces work.\nSuppose within the girdle of these walls\nAre now confin\u2019d two mighty monarchies,\nWhose high upreared and abutting fronts\nThe perilous narrow ocean parts asunder;\nPiece out our imperfections with your thoughts.\nInto a thousand parts divide one man,\nAnd make imaginary puissance.\nThink, when we talk of horses, that you see them\nPrinting their proud hoofs i\u2019 th\u2019 receiving earth.\nFor \u2019tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,\nCarry them here and there, jumping o\u2019er times,\nTurning the accomplishment of many years\nInto an hour-glass: for the which supply,\nAdmit me Chorus to this history;\nWho prologue-like your humble patience pray,\nGently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\nACT I.\n\nSCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the King\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nMy lord, I\u2019ll tell you, that self bill is urg\u2019d\nWhich in the eleventh year of the last king\u2019s reign\nWas like, and had indeed against us passed\nBut that the scambling and unquiet time\nDid push it out of farther question.\n\nELY.\nBut how, my lord, shall we resist it now?\n\nCANTERBURY.\nIt must be thought on. If it pass against us,\nWe lose the better half of our possession:\nFor all the temporal lands, which men devout\nBy testament have given to the Church,\nWould they strip from us; being valu\u2019d thus:\nAs much as would maintain, to the King\u2019s honour,\nFull fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,\nSix thousand and two hundred good esquires;\nAnd, to relief of lazars and weak age,\nOf indigent faint souls past corporal toil,\nA hundred almshouses right well supplied;\nAnd to the coffers of the King beside,\nA thousand pounds by th\u2019 year. Thus runs the bill.\n\nELY.\nThis would drink deep.\n\nCANTERBURY.\n\u2019Twould drink the cup and all.\n\nELY.\nBut what prevention?\n\nCANTERBURY.\nThe King is full of grace and fair regard.\n\nELY.\nAnd a true lover of the holy Church.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nThe courses of his youth promis\u2019d it not.\nThe breath no sooner left his father\u2019s body\nBut that his wildness, mortified in him,\nSeemed to die too; yea, at that very moment\nConsideration like an angel came\nAnd whipped th\u2019 offending Adam out of him,\nLeaving his body as a paradise\nT\u2019 envelope and contain celestial spirits.\nNever was such a sudden scholar made,\nNever came reformation in a flood\nWith such a heady currance scouring faults,\nNor never Hydra-headed wilfulness\nSo soon did lose his seat, and all at once,\nAs in this king.\n\nELY.\nWe are blessed in the change.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nHear him but reason in divinity\nAnd, all-admiring, with an inward wish\nYou would desire the King were made a prelate;\nHear him debate of commonwealth affairs,\nYou would say it hath been all in all his study;\nList his discourse of war, and you shall hear\nA fearful battle rendered you in music;\nTurn him to any cause of policy,\nThe Gordian knot of it he will unloose,\nFamiliar as his garter; that, when he speaks,\nThe air, a chartered libertine, is still,\nAnd the mute wonder lurketh in men\u2019s ears\nTo steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;\nSo that the art and practic part of life\nMust be the mistress to this theoric:\nWhich is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,\nSince his addiction was to courses vain,\nHis companies unlettered, rude, and shallow,\nHis hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports,\nAnd never noted in him any study,\nAny retirement, any sequestration\nFrom open haunts and popularity.\n\nELY.\nThe strawberry grows underneath the nettle,\nAnd wholesome berries thrive and ripen best\nNeighboured by fruit of baser quality;\nAnd so the Prince obscured his contemplation\nUnder the veil of wildness, which, no doubt,\nGrew like the summer grass, fastest by night,\nUnseen, yet crescive in his faculty.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nIt must be so, for miracles are ceased,\nAnd therefore we must needs admit the means\nHow things are perfected.\n\nELY.\nBut, my good lord,\nHow now for mitigation of this bill\nUrged by the Commons? Doth his Majesty\nIncline to it, or no?\n\nCANTERBURY.\nHe seems indifferent,\nOr rather swaying more upon our part\nThan cherishing th\u2019 exhibitors against us;\nFor I have made an offer to his Majesty,\nUpon our spiritual convocation\nAnd in regard of causes now in hand,\nWhich I have opened to his Grace at large,\nAs touching France, to give a greater sum\nThan ever at one time the clergy yet\nDid to his predecessors part withal.\n\nELY.\nHow did this offer seem received, my lord?\n\nCANTERBURY.\nWith good acceptance of his Majesty;\nSave that there was not time enough to hear,\nAs I perceived his Grace would fain have done,\nThe severals and unhidden passages\nOf his true titles to some certain dukedoms,\nAnd generally to the crown and seat of France,\nDerived from Edward, his great-grandfather.\n\nELY.\nWhat was th\u2019 impediment that broke this off?\n\nCANTERBURY.\nThe French ambassador upon that instant\nCraved audience; and the hour, I think, is come\nTo give him hearing. Is it four o\u2019clock?\n\nELY.\nIt is.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nThen go we in, to know his embassy,\nWhich I could with a ready guess declare\nBefore the Frenchman speak a word of it.\n\nELY.\nI\u2019ll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. The same. The presence chamber.\n\n Enter King Henry, Gloucester, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick, Westmorland,\n Exeter and Attendants.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWhere is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?\n\nEXETER.\nNot here in presence.\n\nKING HENRY.\nSend for him, good uncle.\n\nWESTMORLAND.\nShall we call in th\u2019 ambassador, my liege?\n\nKING HENRY.\nNot yet, my cousin. We would be resolved,\nBefore we hear him, of some things of weight\nThat task our thoughts concerning us and France.\n\n Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nGod and his angels guard your sacred throne\nAnd make you long become it!\n\nKING HENRY.\nSure, we thank you.\nMy learned lord, we pray you to proceed\nAnd justly and religiously unfold\nWhy the law Salic that they have in France\nOr should or should not bar us in our claim.\nAnd God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,\nThat you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,\nOr nicely charge your understanding soul\nWith opening titles miscreate, whose right\nSuits not in native colours with the truth;\nFor God doth know how many now in health\nShall drop their blood in approbation\nOf what your reverence shall incite us to.\nTherefore take heed how you impawn our person,\nHow you awake our sleeping sword of war.\nWe charge you in the name of God, take heed;\nFor never two such kingdoms did contend\nWithout much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops\nAre every one a woe, a sore complaint\n\u2019Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords\nThat makes such waste in brief mortality.\nUnder this conjuration speak, my lord,\nFor we will hear, note, and believe in heart\nThat what you speak is in your conscience washed\nAs pure as sin with baptism.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nThen hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,\nThat owe yourselves, your lives, and services\nTo this imperial throne. There is no bar\nTo make against your Highness\u2019 claim to France\nBut this, which they produce from Pharamond:\n_In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant_,\n\u201cNo woman shall succeed in Salic land;\u201d\nWhich Salic land the French unjustly gloze\nTo be the realm of France, and Pharamond\nThe founder of this law and female bar.\nYet their own authors faithfully affirm\nThat the land Salic is in Germany,\nBetween the floods of Sala and of Elbe;\nWhere Charles the Great, having subdu\u2019d the Saxons,\nThere left behind and settled certain French;\nWho, holding in disdain the German women\nFor some dishonest manners of their life,\nEstablish\u2019d then this law, to wit, no female\nShould be inheritrix in Salic land;\nWhich Salic, as I said, \u2019twixt Elbe and Sala,\nIs at this day in Germany call\u2019d Meissen.\nThen doth it well appear the Salic law\nWas not devised for the realm of France;\nNor did the French possess the Salic land\nUntil four hundred one and twenty years\nAfter defunction of King Pharamond,\nIdly suppos\u2019d the founder of this law,\nWho died within the year of our redemption\nFour hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great\nSubdu\u2019d the Saxons, and did seat the French\nBeyond the river Sala, in the year\nEight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,\nKing Pepin, which deposed Childeric,\nDid, as heir general, being descended\nOf Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,\nMake claim and title to the crown of France.\nHugh Capet also, who usurp\u2019d the crown\nOf Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male\nOf the true line and stock of Charles the Great,\nTo find his title with some shows of truth,\nThough, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,\nConvey\u2019d himself as the heir to the Lady Lingare,\nDaughter to Charlemain, who was the son\nTo Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son\nOf Charles the Great. Also, King Lewis the Tenth,\nWho was sole heir to the usurper Capet,\nCould not keep quiet in his conscience,\nWearing the crown of France, till satisfied\nThat fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,\nWas lineal of the Lady Ermengare,\nDaughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorraine;\nBy the which marriage the line of Charles the Great\nWas re-united to the crown of France.\nSo that, as clear as is the summer\u2019s sun,\nKing Pepin\u2019s title and Hugh Capet\u2019s claim,\nKing Lewis his satisfaction, all appear\nTo hold in right and title of the female.\nSo do the kings of France unto this day,\nHowbeit they would hold up this Salic law\nTo bar your Highness claiming from the female,\nAnd rather choose to hide them in a net\nThan amply to imbar their crooked titles\nUsurp\u2019d from you and your progenitors.\n\nKING HENRY.\nMay I with right and conscience make this claim?\n\nCANTERBURY.\nThe sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\nFor in the Book of Numbers is it writ,\n\u201cWhen the man dies, let the inheritance\nDescend unto the daughter.\u201d Gracious lord,\nStand for your own! Unwind your bloody flag!\nLook back into your mighty ancestors!\nGo, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire\u2019s tomb,\nFrom whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,\nAnd your great-uncle\u2019s, Edward the Black Prince,\nWho on the French ground play\u2019d a tragedy,\nMaking defeat on the full power of France,\nWhiles his most mighty father on a hill\nStood smiling to behold his lion\u2019s whelp\nForage in blood of French nobility.\nO noble English, that could entertain\nWith half their forces the full pride of France\nAnd let another half stand laughing by,\nAll out of work and cold for action!\n\nELY.\nAwake remembrance of these valiant dead,\nAnd with your puissant arm renew their feats.\nYou are their heir; you sit upon their throne;\nThe blood and courage that renowned them\nRuns in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege\nIs in the very May-morn of his youth,\nRipe for exploits and mighty enterprises.\n\nEXETER.\nYour brother kings and monarchs of the earth\nDo all expect that you should rouse yourself,\nAs did the former lions of your blood.\n\nWESTMORLAND.\nThey know your Grace hath cause and means and might;\nSo hath your Highness. Never King of England\nHad nobles richer, and more loyal subjects,\nWhose hearts have left their bodies here in England\nAnd lie pavilion\u2019d in the fields of France.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nO, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,\nWith blood and sword and fire to win your right;\nIn aid whereof we of the spiritualty\nWill raise your Highness such a mighty sum\nAs never did the clergy at one time\nBring in to any of your ancestors.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWe must not only arm to invade the French,\nBut lay down our proportions to defend\nAgainst the Scot, who will make road upon us\nWith all advantages.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nThey of those marches, gracious sovereign,\nShall be a wall sufficient to defend\nOur inland from the pilfering borderers.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWe do not mean the coursing snatchers only,\nBut fear the main intendment of the Scot,\nWho hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;\nFor you shall read that my great-grandfather\nNever went with his forces into France\nBut that the Scot on his unfurnish\u2019d kingdom\nCame pouring, like the tide into a breach,\nWith ample and brim fullness of his force,\nGalling the gleaned land with hot assays,\nGirdling with grievous siege castles and towns;\nThat England, being empty of defence,\nHath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nShe hath been then more fear\u2019d than harm\u2019d, my liege;\nFor hear her but exampl\u2019d by herself:\nWhen all her chivalry hath been in France,\nAnd she a mourning widow of her nobles,\nShe hath herself not only well defended\nBut taken and impounded as a stray\nThe King of Scots; whom she did send to France\nTo fill King Edward\u2019s fame with prisoner kings,\nAnd make her chronicle as rich with praise\nAs is the ooze and bottom of the sea\nWith sunken wreck and sumless treasuries.\n\nWESTMORLAND.\nBut there\u2019s a saying very old and true,\n\u201cIf that you will France win,\nThen with Scotland first begin.\u201d\nFor once the eagle England being in prey,\nTo her unguarded nest the weasel Scot\nComes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,\nPlaying the mouse in absence of the cat,\nTo tear and havoc more than she can eat.\n\nEXETER.\nIt follows then the cat must stay at home;\nYet that is but a crush\u2019d necessity,\nSince we have locks to safeguard necessaries,\nAnd pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.\nWhile that the armed hand doth fight abroad,\nThe advised head defends itself at home;\nFor government, though high and low and lower,\nPut into parts, doth keep in one consent,\nCongreeing in a full and natural close,\nLike music.\n\nCANTERBURY.\nTherefore doth heaven divide\nThe state of man in divers functions,\nSetting endeavour in continual motion,\nTo which is fixed, as an aim or butt,\nObedience; for so work the honey-bees,\nCreatures that by a rule in nature teach\nThe act of order to a peopled kingdom.\nThey have a king and officers of sorts,\nWhere some, like magistrates, correct at home,\nOthers like merchants, venture trade abroad,\nOthers, like soldiers, armed in their stings,\nMake boot upon the summer\u2019s velvet buds,\nWhich pillage they with merry march bring home\nTo the tent-royal of their emperor;\nWho, busied in his majesty, surveys\nThe singing masons building roofs of gold,\nThe civil citizens kneading up the honey,\nThe poor mechanic porters crowding in\nTheir heavy burdens at his narrow gate,\nThe sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,\nDelivering o\u2019er to executors pale\nThe lazy yawning drone. I this infer,\nThat many things, having full reference\nTo one consent, may work contrariously.\nAs many arrows, loosed several ways,\nCome to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;\nAs many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;\nAs many lines close in the dial\u2019s centre;\nSo many a thousand actions, once afoot,\nEnd in one purpose, and be all well borne\nWithout defeat. Therefore to France, my liege!\nDivide your happy England into four,\nWhereof take you one quarter into France,\nAnd you withal shall make all Gallia shake.\nIf we, with thrice such powers left at home,\nCannot defend our own doors from the dog,\nLet us be worried and our nation lose\nThe name of hardiness and policy.\n\nKING HENRY.\nCall in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.\n\n [_Exeunt some Attendants._]\n\nNow are we well resolv\u2019d; and, by God\u2019s help,\nAnd yours, the noble sinews of our power,\nFrance being ours, we\u2019ll bend it to our awe,\nOr break it all to pieces. Or there we\u2019ll sit,\nRuling in large and ample empery\nO\u2019er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,\nOr lay these bones in an unworthy urn,\nTombless, with no remembrance over them.\nEither our history shall with full mouth\nSpeak freely of our acts, or else our grave,\nLike Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,\nNot worshipp\u2019d with a waxen epitaph.\n\n Enter Ambassadors of France.\n\nNow are we well prepar\u2019d to know the pleasure\nOf our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear\nYour greeting is from him, not from the King.\n\nFIRST AMBASSADOR.\nMay\u2019t please your Majesty to give us leave\nFreely to render what we have in charge,\nOr shall we sparingly show you far off\nThe Dauphin\u2019s meaning and our embassy?\n\nKING HENRY.\nWe are no tyrant, but a Christian king,\nUnto whose grace our passion is as subject\nAs is our wretches fett\u2019red in our prisons;\nTherefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness\nTell us the Dauphin\u2019s mind.\n\nAMBASSADOR.\nThus, then, in few.\nYour Highness, lately sending into France,\nDid claim some certain dukedoms, in the right\nOf your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.\nIn answer of which claim, the prince our master\nSays that you savour too much of your youth,\nAnd bids you be advis\u2019d there\u2019s nought in France\nThat can be with a nimble galliard won.\nYou cannot revel into dukedoms there.\nHe therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,\nThis tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,\nDesires you let the dukedoms that you claim\nHear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWhat treasure, uncle?\n\nEXETER.\nTennis-balls, my liege.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWe are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.\nHis present and your pains we thank you for.\nWhen we have match\u2019d our rackets to these balls,\nWe will, in France, by God\u2019s grace, play a set\nShall strike his father\u2019s crown into the hazard.\nTell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler\nThat all the courts of France will be disturb\u2019d\nWith chaces. And we understand him well,\nHow he comes o\u2019er us with our wilder days,\nNot measuring what use we made of them.\nWe never valu\u2019d this poor seat of England;\nAnd therefore, living hence, did give ourself\nTo barbarous licence; as \u2019tis ever common\nThat men are merriest when they are from home.\nBut tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,\nBe like a king, and show my sail of greatness\nWhen I do rouse me in my throne of France.\nFor that I have laid by my majesty\nAnd plodded like a man for working days,\nBut I will rise there with so full a glory\nThat I will dazzle all the eyes of France,\nYea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.\nAnd tell the pleasant prince this mock of his\nHath turn\u2019d his balls to gun-stones, and his soul\nShall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance\nThat shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows\nShall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands,\nMock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;\nAnd some are yet ungotten and unborn\nThat shall have cause to curse the Dauphin\u2019s scorn.\nBut this lies all within the will of God,\nTo whom I do appeal; and in whose name\nTell you the Dauphin I am coming on\nTo venge me as I may, and to put forth\nMy rightful hand in a well-hallow\u2019d cause.\nSo get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin\nHis jest will savour but of shallow wit,\nWhen thousands weep more than did laugh at it.\u2014\nConvey them with safe conduct.\u2014Fare you well.\n\n [_Exeunt Ambassadors._]\n\nEXETER.\nThis was a merry message.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWe hope to make the sender blush at it.\nTherefore, my lords, omit no happy hour\nThat may give furtherance to our expedition;\nFor we have now no thought in us but France,\nSave those to God, that run before our business.\nTherefore, let our proportions for these wars\nBe soon collected, and all things thought upon\nThat may with reasonable swiftness add\nMore feathers to our wings; for, God before,\nWe\u2019ll chide this Dauphin at his father\u2019s door.\nTherefore let every man now task his thought,\nThat this fair action may on foot be brought.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT II.\n\n Flourish. Enter Chorus.\n\nCHORUS.\nNow all the youth of England are on fire,\nAnd silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.\nNow thrive the armourers, and honour\u2019s thought\nReigns solely in the breast of every man.\nThey sell the pasture now to buy the horse,\nFollowing the mirror of all Christian kings,\nWith winged heels, as English Mercuries.\nFor now sits Expectation in the air,\nAnd hides a sword from hilts unto the point\nWith crowns imperial, crowns, and coronets,\nPromis\u2019d to Harry and his followers.\nThe French, advis\u2019d by good intelligence\nOf this most dreadful preparation,\nShake in their fear, and with pale policy\nSeek to divert the English purposes.\nO England! model to thy inward greatness,\nLike little body with a mighty heart,\nWhat mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,\nWere all thy children kind and natural!\nBut see thy fault! France hath in thee found out\nA nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills\nWith treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,\nOne, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,\nHenry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,\nSir Thomas Grey, knight of Northumberland,\nHave, for the gilt of France,\u2014O guilt indeed!\u2014\nConfirm\u2019d conspiracy with fearful France;\nAnd by their hands this grace of kings must die,\nIf hell and treason hold their promises,\nEre he take ship for France, and in Southampton.\nLinger your patience on, and we\u2019ll digest\nThe abuse of distance, force a play.\nThe sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;\nThe King is set from London; and the scene\nIs now transported, gentles, to Southampton.\nThere is the playhouse now, there must you sit;\nAnd thence to France shall we convey you safe,\nAnd bring you back, charming the narrow seas\nTo give you gentle pass; for, if we may,\nWe\u2019ll not offend one stomach with our play.\nBut, till the King come forth, and not till then,\nUnto Southampton do we shift our scene.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE I.

I say little; but when time shall serve, there\nshall be smiles; but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight, but I\nwill wink and hold out mine iron. It is a simple one, but what though?\nIt will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another man\u2019s sword\nwill; and there\u2019s an end.\n\nBARDOLPH.\nI will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and we\u2019ll be all three\nsworn brothers to France. Let it be so, good Corporal Nym.\n\nNYM.\nFaith, I will live so long as I may, that\u2019s the certain of it; and when\nI cannot live any longer, I will do as I may. That is my rest, that is\nthe rendezvous of it.\n\nBARDOLPH.\nIt is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly; and\ncertainly she did you wrong, for you were troth-plight to her.\n\nNYM.\nI cannot tell. Things must be as they may. Men may sleep, and they may\nhave their throats about them at that time; and some say knives have\nedges. It must be as it may. Though patience be a tired mare, yet she\nwill plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I cannot tell.\n\n Enter Pistol and Hostess.\n\nBARDOLPH.\nHere comes Ancient Pistol and his wife.

My Lord of Cambridge here,\nYou know how apt our love was to accord\nTo furnish him with an appertinents\nBelonging to his honour; and this man\nHath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspir\u2019d\nAnd sworn unto the practices of France\nTo kill us here in Hampton; to the which\nThis knight, no less for bounty bound to us\nThan Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O\nWhat shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,\nIngrateful, savage, and inhuman creature!\nThou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,\nThat knew\u2019st the very bottom of my soul,\nThat almost mightst have coin\u2019d me into gold,\nWouldst thou have practis\u2019d on me for thy use,\u2014\nMay it be possible that foreign hire\nCould out of thee extract one spark of evil\nThat might annoy my finger? \u2019Tis so strange,\nThat, though the truth of it stands off as gross\nAs black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.\nTreason and murder ever kept together,\nAs two yoke-devils sworn to either\u2019s purpose,\nWorking so grossly in a natural cause\nThat admiration did not whoop at them;\nBut thou, \u2019gainst all proportion, didst bring in\nWonder to wait on treason and on murder;\nAnd whatsoever cunning fiend it was\nThat wrought upon thee so preposterously\nHath got the voice in hell for excellence;\nAnd other devils that suggest by treasons\nDo botch and bungle up damnation\nWith patches, colours, and with forms being fetch\u2019d\nFrom glist\u2019ring semblances of piety.\nBut he that temper\u2019d thee bade thee stand up,\nGave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,\nUnless to dub thee with the name of traitor.\nIf that same demon that hath gull\u2019d thee thus\nShould with his lion gait walk the whole world,\nHe might return to vasty Tartar back,\nAnd tell the legions, \u201cI can never win\nA soul so easy as that Englishman\u2019s.\u201d\nO, how hast thou with jealousy infected\nThe sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?\nWhy, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learned?\nWhy, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?\nWhy, so didst thou. Seem they religious?\nWhy, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,\nFree from gross passion or of mirth or anger,\nConstant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,\nGarnish\u2019d and deck\u2019d in modest complement,\nNot working with the eye without the ear,\nAnd but in purged judgement trusting neither?\nSuch and so finely bolted didst thou seem.\nAnd thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot\nTo mark the full-fraught man and best indued\nWith some suspicion. I will weep for thee;\nFor this revolt of thine, methinks, is like\nAnother fall of man. Their faults are open.\nArrest them to the answer of the law;\nAnd God acquit them of their practices!\n\nEXETER.\nI arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Richard Earl of\nCambridge.\nI arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Henry Lord Scroop of\nMasham.\nI arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Thomas Grey, knight, of\nNorthumberland.\n\nSCROOP.\nOur purposes God justly hath discover\u2019d,\nAnd I repent my fault more than my death,\nWhich I beseech your Highness to forgive,\nAlthough my body pay the price of it.\n\nCAMBRIDGE.\nFor me, the gold of France did not seduce,\nAlthough I did admit it as a motive\nThe sooner to effect what I intended.\nBut God be thanked for prevention,\nWhich I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,\nBeseeching God and you to pardon me.\n\nGREY.\nNever did faithful subject more rejoice\nAt the discovery of most dangerous treason\nThan I do at this hour joy o\u2019er myself,\nPrevented from a damned enterprise.\nMy fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.\n\nKING HENRY.\nGod quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.\nYou have conspir\u2019d against our royal person,\nJoin\u2019d with an enemy proclaim\u2019d, and from his coffers\nReceived the golden earnest of our death;\nWherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,\nHis princes and his peers to servitude,\nHis subjects to oppression and contempt,\nAnd his whole kingdom into desolation.\nTouching our person seek we no revenge;\nBut we our kingdom\u2019s safety must so tender,\nWhose ruin you have sought, that to her laws\nWe do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,\nPoor miserable wretches, to your death,\nThe taste whereof God of his mercy give\nYou patience to endure, and true repentance\nOf all your dear offences! Bear them hence.\n\n [_Exeunt Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, guarded._]\n\nNow, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof\nShall be to you, as us, like glorious.\nWe doubt not of a fair and lucky war,\nSince God so graciously hath brought to light\nThis dangerous treason lurking in our way\nTo hinder our beginnings.

Now I,\nto comfort him, bid him \u2019a should not think of God; I hop\u2019d there was\nno need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So \u2019a bade me\nlay more clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt them,\nand they were as cold as any stone.

Good my sovereign,\nTake up the English short, and let them know\nOf what a monarchy you are the head.\nSelf-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin\nAs self-neglecting.\n\n Enter Exeter.\n\nFRENCH KING.\nFrom our brother of England?\n\nEXETER.\nFrom him; and thus he greets your Majesty:\nHe wills you, in the name of God Almighty,\nThat you divest yourself, and lay apart\nThe borrowed glories that by gift of heaven,\nBy law of nature and of nations, \u2019longs\nTo him and to his heirs; namely, the crown\nAnd all wide-stretched honours that pertain\nBy custom and the ordinance of times\nUnto the crown of France. That you may know\n\u2019Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim\nPick\u2019d from the worm-holes of long-vanish\u2019d days,\nNor from the dust of old oblivion rak\u2019d,\nHe sends you this most memorable line,\nIn every branch truly demonstrative;\nWilling you overlook this pedigree;\nAnd when you find him evenly deriv\u2019d\nFrom his most fam\u2019d of famous ancestors,\nEdward the Third, he bids you then resign\nYour crown and kingdom, indirectly held\nFrom him, the native and true challenger.\n\nFRENCH KING.\nOr else what follows?\n\nEXETER.\nBloody constraint; for if you hide the crown\nEven in your hearts, there will he rake for it.\nTherefore in fierce tempest is he coming,\nIn thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,\nThat, if requiring fail, he will compel;\nAnd bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,\nDeliver up the crown, and to take mercy\nOn the poor souls for whom this hungry war\nOpens his vasty jaws; and on your head\nTurning the widows\u2019 tears, the orphans\u2019 cries,\nThe dead men\u2019s blood, the pining maidens\u2019 groans,\nFor husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers,\nThat shall be swallowed in this controversy.\nThis is his claim, his threat\u2019ning, and my message;\nUnless the Dauphin be in presence here,\nTo whom expressly I bring greeting too.\n\nFRENCH KING.\nFor us, we will consider of this further.\nTomorrow shall you bear our full intent\nBack to our brother of England.\n\nDAUPHIN.\nFor the Dauphin,\nI stand here for him. What to him from England?\n\nEXETER.\nScorn and defiance. Slight regard, contempt,\nAnd anything that may not misbecome\nThe mighty sender, doth he prize you at.\nThus says my king: an if your father\u2019s Highness\nDo not, in grant of all demands at large,\nSweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty,\nHe\u2019ll call you to so hot an answer of it\nThat caves and womby vaultages of France\nShall chide your trespass and return your mock\nIn second accent of his ordinance.\n\nDAUPHIN.\nSay, if my father render fair return,\nIt is against my will; for I desire\nNothing but odds with England. To that end,\nAs matching to his youth and vanity,\nI did present him with the Paris balls.\n\nEXETER.\nHe\u2019ll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,\nWere it the mistress-court of mighty Europe;\nAnd, be assur\u2019d, you\u2019ll find a difference,\nAs we his subjects have in wonder found,\nBetween the promise of his greener days\nAnd these he masters now. Now he weighs time\nEven to the utmost grain. That you shall read\nIn your own losses, if he stay in France.\n\nFRENCH KING.\nTomorrow shall you know our mind at full.\n\n [_Flourish._]\n\nEXETER.\nDispatch us with all speed, lest that our king\nCome here himself to question our delay;\nFor he is footed in this land already.\n\nFRENCH KING.\nYou shall be soon dispatch\u2019d with fair conditions.\nA night is but small breath and little pause\nTo answer matters of this consequence.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT III.\n\n Flourish.

O, do but think\nYou stand upon the rivage and behold\nA city on the inconstant billows dancing;\nFor so appears this fleet majestical,\nHolding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!\nGrapple your minds to sternage of this navy,\nAnd leave your England, as dead midnight still,\nGuarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,\nEither past or not arriv\u2019d to pith and puissance.\nFor who is he, whose chin is but enrich\u2019d\nWith one appearing hair, that will not follow\nThese cull\u2019d and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?\nWork, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;\nBehold the ordnance on their carriages,\nWith fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.\nSuppose the ambassador from the French comes back,\nTells Harry that the King doth offer him\nKatharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,\nSome petty and unprofitable dukedoms.\nThe offer likes not; and the nimble gunner\nWith linstock now the devilish cannon touches,\n\n [_Alarum, and chambers go off._]\n\nAnd down goes all before them.

I would give all my fame for a\npot of ale and safety.\n\nPISTOL.\nAnd I.\n    If wishes would prevail with me,\n    My purpose should not fail with me,\n    But thither would I hie.\n\nBOY.\n    As duly,\n    But not as truly,\n    As bird doth sing on bough.\n\n Enter Fluellen.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nUp to the breach, you dogs! Avaunt, you cullions!\n\n [_Driving them forward._]\n\nPISTOL.\nBe merciful, great Duke, to men of mould.\nAbate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,\nAbate thy rage, great Duke!\nGood bawcock, bate thy rage; use lenity, sweet chuck!\n\nNYM.\nThese be good humours! Your honour wins bad humours.\n\n [_Exeunt all but Boy._]\n\nBOY.\nAs young as I am, I have observ\u2019d these three swashers. I am boy to\nthem all three; but all they three, though they would serve me, could\nnot be man to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man.\nFor Bardolph, he is white-liver\u2019d and red-fac\u2019d; by the means whereof\n\u2019a faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue\nand a quiet sword; by the means whereof \u2019a breaks words, and keeps\nwhole weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the\nbest men; and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest \u2019a should be\nthought a coward. But his few bad words are match\u2019d with as few good\ndeeds; for \u2019a never broke any man\u2019s head but his own, and that was\nagainst a post when he was drunk. They will steal anything, and call it\npurchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold\nit for three half-pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in\nfilching, and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel. I knew by that piece\nof service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar\nwith men\u2019s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers; which makes\nmuch against my manhood, if I should take from another\u2019s pocket to put\ninto mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them,\nand seek some better service. Their villainy goes against my weak\nstomach, and therefore I must cast it up.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n Enter Gower and Fluellen.\n\nGOWER.\nCaptain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines.\nThe Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nTo the mines! Tell you the Duke, it is not so good to come to the\nmines; for, look you, the mines is not according to the disciplines of\nthe war. The concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you, the\nathversary, you may discuss unto the Duke, look you, is digt himself\nfour yard under the countermines. By Cheshu, I think \u2019a will plow up\nall, if there is not better directions.\n\nGOWER.\nThe Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is given, is\naltogether directed by an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i\u2019 faith.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nIt is Captain Macmorris, is it not?\n\nGOWER.\nI think it be.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nBy Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world. I will verify as much in his\nbeard. He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars,\nlook you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.\n\n Enter Macmorris and Captain Jamy.\n\nGOWER.\nHere \u2019a comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nCaptain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman, that is certain; and\nof great expedition and knowledge in the anchient wars, upon my\nparticular knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu, he will maintain his\nargument as well as any military man in the world, in the disciplines\nof the pristine wars of the Romans.\n\nJAMY.\nI say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nGod-den to your worship, good Captain James.\n\nGOWER.\nHow now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit the mines?\nHave the pioneers given o\u2019er?\n\nMACMORRIS.\nBy Chrish, la! \u2019tish ill done! The work ish give over, the trompet\nsound the retreat. By my hand I swear, and my father\u2019s soul, the work\nish ill done; it ish give over. I would have blowed up the town, so\nChrish save me, la! in an hour. O, \u2019tish ill done, \u2019tish ill done; by\nmy hand, \u2019tish ill done!\n\nFLUELLEN.\nCaptain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you voutsafe me, look you, a\nfew disputations with you, as partly touching or concerning the\ndisciplines of the war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument, look\nyou, and friendly communication; partly to satisfy my opinion, and\npartly for the satisfaction, look you, of my mind, as touching the\ndirection of the military discipline; that is the point.\n\nJAMY.\nIt sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath: and I sall quit you\nwith gud leve, as I may pick occasion; that sall I, marry.\n\nMACMORRIS.\nIt is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me. The day is hot, and the\nweather, and the wars, and the King, and the Dukes. It is no time to\ndiscourse. The town is beseech\u2019d, and the trumpet call us to the\nbreach, and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing. \u2019Tis shame for us all.\nSo God sa\u2019 me, \u2019tis shame to stand still; it is shame, by my hand; and\nthere is throats to be cut, and works to be done; and there ish nothing\ndone, so Chrish sa\u2019 me, la!\n\nJAMY.\nBy the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber, I\u2019ll\nde gud service, or I\u2019ll lig i\u2019 the grund for it; ay, or go to death;\nand I\u2019ll pay\u2019t as valorously as I may, that sall I suerly do, that is\nthe breff and the long. Marry, I wad full fain heard some question\n\u2019tween you tway.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nCaptain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your correction, there is\nnot many of your nation\u2014\n\nMACMORRIS.\nOf my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain, and a bastard, and a\nknave, and a rascal? What ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?\n\nFLUELLEN.\nLook you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant, Captain\nMacmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that\naffability as in discretion you ought to use me, look you, being as\ngood a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of war, and in the\nderivation of my birth, and in other particularities.\n\nMACMORRIS.\nI do not know you so good a man as myself. So Chrish save me,\nI will cut off your head.\n\nGOWER.\nGentlemen both, you will mistake each other.\n\nJAMY.\nAh! that\u2019s a foul fault.\n\n [_A parley sounded._]\n\nGOWER.\nThe town sounds a parley.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nCaptain Macmorris, when there is more better opportunity to be\nrequired, look you, I will be so bold as to tell you I know the\ndisciplines of war; and there is an end.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III.

Therefore, you men of Harfleur,\nTake pity of your town and of your people,\nWhiles yet my soldiers are in my command,\nWhiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace\nO\u2019erblows the filthy and contagious clouds\nOf heady murder, spoil, and villainy.\nIf not, why, in a moment look to see\nThe blind and bloody soldier with foul hand\nDefile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;\nYour fathers taken by the silver beards,\nAnd their most reverend heads dash\u2019d to the walls;\nYour naked infants spitted upon pikes,\nWhiles the mad mothers with their howls confus\u2019d\nDo break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry\nAt Herod\u2019s bloody-hunting slaughtermen.\nWhat say you? Will you yield, and this avoid,\nOr, guilty in defence, be thus destroy\u2019d?\n\nGOVERNOR.\nOur expectation hath this day an end.\nThe Dauphin, whom of succours we entreated,\nReturns us that his powers are yet not ready\nTo raise so great a siege.

The English camp in Picardy.\n\n Enter Gower and Fluellen, meeting.\n\nGOWER.\nHow now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?\n\nFLUELLEN.\nI assure you, there is very excellent services committed at the bridge.\n\nGOWER.\nIs the Duke of Exeter safe?\n\nFLUELLEN.\nThe Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon; and a man that I\nlove and honour with my soul, and my heart, and my duty, and my life,\nand my living, and my uttermost power. He is not\u2014God be praised and\nblessed!\u2014any hurt in the world; but keeps the bridge most valiantly,\nwith excellent discipline. There is an anchient lieutenant there at the\npridge, I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark\nAntony; and he is a man of no estimation in the world, but I did see\nhim do as gallant service.\n\nGOWER.\nWhat do you call him?\n\nFLUELLEN.\nHe is call\u2019d Anchient Pistol.\n\nGOWER.\nI know him not.\n\n Enter Pistol.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nHere is the man.\n\nPISTOL.\nCaptain, I thee beseech to do me favours.\nThe Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nAy, I praise God; and I have merited some love at his hands.\n\nPISTOL.\nBardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,\nAnd of buxom valour, hath by cruel fate\nAnd giddy Fortune\u2019s furious fickle wheel,\nThat goddess blind,\nThat stands upon the rolling restless stone\u2014\n\nFLUELLEN.\nBy your patience, Anchient Pistol. Fortune is painted blind, with a\nmuffler afore his eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and\nshe is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral\nof it, that she is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and\nvariation; and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,\nwhich rolls, and rolls, and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most\nexcellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent moral.\n\nPISTOL.\nFortune is Bardolph\u2019s foe, and frowns on him;\nFor he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must \u2019a be,\u2014\nA damned death!\nLet gallows gape for dog; let man go free,\nAnd let not hemp his windpipe suffocate.\nBut Exeter hath given the doom of death\nFor pax of little price.\nTherefore, go speak; the Duke will hear thy voice;\nAnd let not Bardolph\u2019s vital thread be cut\nWith edge of penny cord and vile reproach.\nSpeak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nAnchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.\n\nPISTOL.\nWhy then, rejoice therefore.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nCertainly, anchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at; for if, look you,\nhe were my brother, I would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure,\nand put him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.\n\nPISTOL.\nDie and be damn\u2019d! and _fico_ for thy friendship!\n\nFLUELLEN.\nIt is well.\n\nPISTOL.\nThe fig of Spain.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nFLUELLEN.\nVery good.\n\nGOWER.\nWhy, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal. I remember him now; a bawd,\na cutpurse.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nI\u2019ll assure you, \u2019a uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall\nsee in a summer\u2019s day. But it is very well; what he has spoke to me,\nthat is well, I warrant you, when time is serve.\n\nGOWER.\nWhy, \u2019t is a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars,\nto grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier.\nAnd such fellows are perfect in the great commanders\u2019 names; and they\nwill learn you by rote where services were done; at such and such a\nsconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who\nwas shot, who disgrac\u2019d, what terms the enemy stood on; and this they\ncon perfectly in the phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned\noaths: and what a beard of the general\u2019s cut and a horrid suit of the\ncamp will do among foaming bottles and ale-wash\u2019d wits, is wonderful to\nbe thought on. But you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or\nelse you may be marvellously mistook.\n\nFLUELLEN.\nI tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is not the man that he\nwould gladly make show to the world he is. If I find a hole in his\ncoat, I will tell him my mind. [_Drum heard._] Hark you, the King is\ncoming, and I must speak with him from the pridge.\n\n Drum and colours. Enter King Henry, Gloucester and his poor soldiers.\n\nGod bless your Majesty!\n\nKING HENRY.\nHow now, Fluellen! cam\u2019st thou from the bridge?\n\nFLUELLEN.\nAy, so please your Majesty. The Duke of Exeter has very gallantly\nmaintain\u2019d the pridge. The French is gone off, look you; and there is\ngallant and most prave passages. Marry, th\u2019 athversary was have\npossession of the pridge; but he is enforced to retire, and the Duke of\nExeter is master of the pridge. I can tell your Majesty, the Duke is a\nprave man.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWhat men have you lost, Fluellen?\n\nFLUELLEN.\nThe perdition of the athversary hath been very great, reasonable great.\nMarry, for my part, I think the Duke hath lost never a man, but one\nthat is like to be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph, if your\nMajesty know the man. His face is all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs,\nand flames o\u2019 fire; and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a\ncoal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red; but his nose is\nexecuted, and his fire\u2019s out.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWe would have all such offenders so cut off; and we give express\ncharge, that in our marches through the country, there be nothing\ncompell\u2019d from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the\nFrench upbraided or abused in disdainful language; for when lenity and\ncruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.\n\n Tucket. Enter Montjoy.\n\nMONTJOY.\nYou know me by my habit.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWell then I know thee. What shall I know of thee?\n\nMONTJOY.\nMy master\u2019s mind.\n\nKING HENRY.\nUnfold it.\n\nMONTJOY.\nThus says my King: Say thou to Harry of England: Though we seem\u2019d dead,\nwe did but sleep; advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him\nwe could have rebuk\u2019d him at Harfleur, but that we thought not good to\nbruise an injury till it were full ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and\nour voice is imperial. England shall repent his folly, see his\nweakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his\nransom; which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we\nhave lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in weight to re-answer,\nhis pettishness would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too\npoor; for the effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too\nfaint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our\nfeet, but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance; and\ntell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose\ncondemnation is pronounc\u2019d. So far my King and master; so much my\noffice.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWhat is thy name? I know thy quality.\n\nMONTJOY.\nMontjoy.\n\nKING HENRY.\nThou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,\nAnd tell thy King I do not seek him now,\nBut could be willing to march on to Calais\nWithout impeachment; for, to say the sooth,\nThough \u2019tis no wisdom to confess so much\nUnto an enemy of craft and vantage,\nMy people are with sickness much enfeebled,\nMy numbers lessen\u2019d, and those few I have\nAlmost no better than so many French;\nWho when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,\nI thought upon one pair of English legs\nDid march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,\nThat I do brag thus! This your air of France\nHath blown that vice in me. I must repent.\nGo therefore, tell thy master here I am;\nMy ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,\nMy army but a weak and sickly guard;\nYet, God before, tell him we will come on,\nThough France himself and such another neighbour\nStand in our way. There\u2019s for thy labour, Montjoy.\nGo, bid thy master well advise himself.\nIf we may pass, we will; if we be hind\u2019red,\nWe shall your tawny ground with your red blood\nDiscolour; and so, Montjoy, fare you well.\nThe sum of all our answer is but this:\nWe would not seek a battle, as we are;\nNor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.\nSo tell your master.\n\nMONTJOY.\nI shall deliver so. Thanks to your Highness.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI hope they will not come upon us now.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWe are in God\u2019s hands, brother, not in theirs.\nMarch to the bridge; it now draws toward night.\nBeyond the river we\u2019ll encamp ourselves,\nAnd on tomorrow bid them march away.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VII. The French camp, near Agincourt.\n\n Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Rambures, Orleans, Dauphin\n with others.\n\nCONSTABLE.\nTut!

I will not change my horse with any that\ntreads but on four pasterns. Ch\u2019ha! He bounds from the earth, as if his\nentrails were hairs; _le cheval volant_, the Pegasus, _qui a les\nnarines de feu!_ When I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk. He trots the\nair; the earth sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his hoof is\nmore musical than the pipe of Hermes.\n\nORLEANS.\nHe\u2019s of the colour of the nutmeg.\n\nDAUPHIN.\nAnd of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus. He is pure\nair and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in\nhim, but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him. He is\nindeed a horse, and all other jades you may call beasts.\n\nCONSTABLE.\nIndeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.\n\nDAUPHIN.\nIt is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the bidding of a\nmonarch, and his countenance enforces homage.\n\nORLEANS.\nNo more, cousin.\n\nDAUPHIN.\nNay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of the lark to\nthe lodging of the lamb, vary deserved praise on my palfrey.

The poor condemned English,\nLike sacrifices, by their watchful fires\nSit patiently and inly ruminate\nThe morning\u2019s danger; and their gesture sad,\nInvesting lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats,\nPresented them unto the gazing moon\nSo many horrid ghosts.

It is the greatest\nadmiration in the universal world, when the true and anchient\nprerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept. If you would take the\npains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall find, I\nwarrant you, that there is no tiddle taddle nor pibble pabble in\nPompey\u2019s camp.

Who goes there?\n\nKING HENRY.\nA friend.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nUnder what captain serve you?\n\nKING HENRY.\nUnder Sir Thomas Erpingham.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nA good old commander and a most kind gentleman. I pray you, what thinks\nhe of our estate?\n\nKING HENRY.\nEven as men wreck\u2019d upon a sand, that look to be wash\u2019d off the next\ntide.\n\nBATES.\nHe hath not told his thought to the King?\n\nKING HENRY.\nNo; nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, I think\nthe King is but a man as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to\nme; the element shows to him as it doth to me; all his senses have but\nhuman conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears\nbut a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet,\nwhen they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees\nreason of fears as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same\nrelish as ours are; yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any\nappearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.\n\nBATES.\nHe may show what outward courage he will; but I believe, as cold a\nnight as \u2019tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I\nwould he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.\n\nKING HENRY.\nBy my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King: I think he would\nnot wish himself anywhere but where he is.\n\nBATES.\nThen I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransomed,\nand a many poor men\u2019s lives saved.\n\nKING HENRY.\nI dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here alone, howsoever\nyou speak this to feel other men\u2019s minds. Methinks I could not die\nanywhere so contented as in the King\u2019s company, his cause being just\nand his quarrel honourable.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nThat\u2019s more than we know.\n\nBATES.\nAy, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough, if we know\nwe are the King\u2019s subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the\nKing wipes the crime of it out of us.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nBut if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning\nto make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopp\u2019d off in a\nbattle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, \u201cWe died at\nsuch a place\u201d; some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon\ntheir wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some\nupon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that\ndie in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when\nblood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be\na black matter for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were\nagainst all proportion of subjection.\n\nKING HENRY.\nSo, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully\nmiscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule,\nshould be imposed upon his father that sent him; or if a servant, under\nhis master\u2019s command transporting a sum of money, be assailed by\nrobbers and die in many irreconcil\u2019d iniquities, you may call the\nbusiness of the master the author of the servant\u2019s damnation. But this\nis not so. The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of\nhis soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; for\nthey purpose not their death, when they purpose their services.\nBesides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come\nto the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted\nsoldiers. Some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and\ncontrived murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of\nperjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored\nthe gentle bosom of Peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men\nhave defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can\noutstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is his beadle,\nwar is his vengeance; so that here men are punish\u2019d for before-breach\nof the King\u2019s laws in now the King\u2019s quarrel. Where they feared the\ndeath, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they\nperish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King guilty of\ntheir damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the\nwhich they are now visited. Every subject\u2019s duty is the King\u2019s; but\nevery subject\u2019s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the\nwars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every mote out of his\nconscience; and dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the\ntime was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained; and in him\nthat escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God so free an\noffer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach\nothers how they should prepare.\n\nWILLIAMS.\n\u2019Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head, the\nKing is not to answer for it.\n\nBATES.\nI do not desire he should answer for me; and yet I determine to fight\nlustily for him.\n\nKING HENRY.\nI myself heard the King say he would not be ransom\u2019d.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nAy, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully; but when our throats are\ncut, he may be ransom\u2019d, and we ne\u2019er the wiser.\n\nKING HENRY.\nIf I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nYou pay him then. That\u2019s a perilous shot out of an elder-gun, that a\npoor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch! You may as\nwell go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a\npeacock\u2019s feather. You\u2019ll never trust his word after! Come, \u2019tis a\nfoolish saying.\n\nKING HENRY.\nYour reproof is something too round. I should be angry with you, if the\ntime were convenient.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nLet it be a quarrel between us if you live.\n\nKING HENRY.\nI embrace it.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nHow shall I know thee again?\n\nKING HENRY.\nGive me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my bonnet; then, if\never thou dar\u2019st acknowledge it, I will make it my quarrel.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nHere\u2019s my glove; give me another of thine.\n\nKING HENRY.\nThere.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nThis will I also wear in my cap. If ever thou come to me and say, after\ntomorrow, \u201cThis is my glove,\u201d by this hand I will take thee a box on\nthe ear.\n\nKING HENRY.\nIf ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nThou dar\u2019st as well be hang\u2019d.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWell, I will do it, though I take thee in the King\u2019s company.\n\nWILLIAMS.\nKeep thy word; fare thee well.\n\nBATES.\nBe friends, you English fools, be friends. We have French quarrels\nenough, if you could tell how to reckon.\n\nKING HENRY.\nIndeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat\nus, for they bear them on their shoulders; but it is no English treason\nto cut French crowns, and tomorrow the King himself will be a clipper.\n\n [_Exeunt soldiers._]\n\n Upon the King! Let us our lives, our souls,\nOur debts, our careful wives,\nOur children, and our sins lay on the King!\nWe must bear all. O hard condition,\nTwin-born with greatness, subject to the breath\nOf every fool, whose sense no more can feel\nBut his own wringing! What infinite heart\u2019s ease\nMust kings neglect, that private men enjoy!\nAnd what have kings, that privates have not too,\nSave ceremony, save general ceremony?\nAnd what art thou, thou idol Ceremony?\nWhat kind of god art thou, that suffer\u2019st more\nOf mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?\nWhat are thy rents?

That I have labour\u2019d,\nWith all my wits, my pains, and strong endeavours,\nTo bring your most imperial Majesties\nUnto this bar and royal interview,\nYour mightiness on both parts best can witness.\nSince then my office hath so far prevail\u2019d\nThat, face to face and royal eye to eye,\nYou have congreeted, let it not disgrace me\nIf I demand, before this royal view,\nWhat rub or what impediment there is,\nWhy that the naked, poor, and mangled Peace,\nDear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births,\nShould not in this best garden of the world,\nOur fertile France, put up her lovely visage?\nAlas, she hath from France too long been chas\u2019d,\nAnd all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,\nCorrupting in it own fertility.\nHer vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,\nUnpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach\u2019d,\nLike prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,\nPut forth disorder\u2019d twigs; her fallow leas\nThe darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory,\nDoth root upon, while that the coulter rusts\nThat should deracinate such savagery;\nThe even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth\nThe freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,\nWanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,\nConceives by idleness, and nothing teems\nBut hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,\nLosing both beauty and utility;\nAnd as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,\nDefective in their natures, grow to wildness.\nEven so our houses and ourselves and children\nHave lost, or do not learn for want of time,\nThe sciences that should become our country;\nBut grow like savages,\u2014as soldiers will\nThat nothing do but meditate on blood,\u2014\nTo swearing and stern looks, diffus\u2019d attire,\nAnd everything that seems unnatural.\nWhich to reduce into our former favour\nYou are assembled; and my speech entreats\nThat I may know the let, why gentle Peace\nShould not expel these inconveniences\nAnd bless us with her former qualities.\n\nKING HENRY.\nIf, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,\nWhose want gives growth to the imperfections\nWhich you have cited, you must buy that peace\nWith full accord to all our just demands;\nWhose tenours and particular effects\nYou have enschedul\u2019d briefly in your hands.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nThe King hath heard them; to the which as yet\nThere is no answer made.\n\nKING HENRY.\nWell, then, the peace,\nWhich you before so urg\u2019d, lies in his answer.\n\nFRENCH KING.\nI have but with a cursorary eye\nO\u2019erglanc\u2019d the articles. Pleaseth your Grace\nTo appoint some of your council presently\nTo sit with us once more, with better heed\nTo re-survey them, we will suddenly\nPass our accept and peremptory answer.\n\nKING HENRY.\nBrother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,\nAnd brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,\nWarwick, and Huntington, go with the King;\nAnd take with you free power to ratify,\nAugment, or alter, as your wisdoms best\nShall see advantageable for our dignity,\nAnything in or out of our demands,\nAnd we\u2019ll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,\nGo with the princes, or stay here with us?\n\nQUEEN ISABEL.\nOur gracious brother, I will go with them.\nHaply a woman\u2019s voice may do some good,\nWhen articles too nicely urg\u2019d be stood on.\n\nKING HENRY.\nYet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:\nShe is our capital demand, compris\u2019d\nWithin the fore-rank of our articles.\n\nQUEEN ISABEL.\nShe hath good leave.\n\n [_Exeunt all except Henry, Katharine and Alice._]\n\nKING HENRY.\nFair Katharine, and most fair,\nWill you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms\nSuch as will enter at a lady\u2019s ear\nAnd plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?\n\nKATHARINE.\nYour Majesty shall mock me; I cannot speak your England.\n\nKING HENRY.\nO fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I\nwill be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue.\nDo you like me, Kate?\n\nKATHARINE.\n_Pardonnez-moi_, I cannot tell wat is \u201clike me.\u201d\n\nKING HENRY.\nAn angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.\n\nKATHARINE.\n_Que dit-il? Que je suis semblable \u00e0 les anges?_\n\nALICE.\n_Oui, vraiment, sauf votre Gr\u00e2ce, ainsi dit-il._\n\nKING HENRY.\nI said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to affirm it.\n\nKATHARINE.\n_O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies._\n\nKING HENRY.\nWhat says she, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?\n\nALICE.\n_Oui_, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits: dat is de\nPrincess.\n\nKING HENRY.\nThe Princess is the better Englishwoman. I\u2019 faith, Kate, my wooing is\nfit for thy understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no better\nEnglish; for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king\nthat thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no\nways to mince it in love, but directly to say, \u201cI love you\u201d; then if\nyou urge me farther than to say, \u201cDo you in faith?\u201d I wear out my suit.\nGive me your answer; i\u2019 faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How\nsay you, lady?\n\nKATHARINE.\n_Sauf votre honneur_, me understand well.\n\nKING HENRY.\nMarry, if you would put me to verses, or to dance for your sake, Kate,\nwhy you undid me; for the one, I have neither words nor measure, and\nfor the other I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure\nin strength. If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vaulting into my\nsaddle with my armour on my back, under the correction of bragging be\nit spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for\nmy love, or bound my horse for her favours, I could lay on like a\nbutcher and sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, Kate,\nI cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning\nin protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use till urg\u2019d,\nnor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper,\nKate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass\nfor love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak\nto thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me; if not,\nto say to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the\nLord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou liv\u2019st, dear Kate, take a\nfellow of plain and uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee\nright, because he hath not the gift to woo in other places; for these\nfellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies\u2019\nfavours, they do always reason themselves out again. What! a speaker is\nbut a prater: a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight\nback will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl\u2019d pate will grow\nbald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good\nheart, Kate, is the sun and the moon; or rather the sun and not the\nmoon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course\ntruly. If thou would have such a one, take me; and take me, take a\nsoldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what say\u2019st thou then to my\nlove? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.\n\nKATHARINE.\nIs it possible dat I should love de enemy of France?\n\nKING HENRY.\nNo; it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate; but,\nin loving me, you should love the friend of France; for I love France\nso well that I will not part with a village of it, I will have it all\nmine; and, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is\nFrance and you are mine.\n\nKATHARINE.\nI cannot tell wat is dat.\n\nKING HENRY.\nNo, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am sure will hang upon my\ntongue like a new-married wife about her husband\u2019s neck, hardly to be\nshook off. _Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le\npossession de moi_,\u2014let me see, what then? Saint Denis be my\nspeed!\u2014_donc votre est France, et vous \u00eates mienne._ It is as easy for\nme, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French. I\nshall never move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.\n\nKATHARINE.\n_Sauf votre honneur, le fran\u00e7ais que vous parlez, il est meilleur que\nl\u2019anglais lequel je parle._\n\nKING HENRY.\nNo, faith, is\u2019t not, Kate; but thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine,\nmost truly-falsely, must needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate,\ndost thou understand thus much English: canst thou love me?\n\nKATHARINE.\nI cannot tell.\n\nKING HENRY.\nCan any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I\u2019ll ask them. Come, I know thou\nlovest me; and at night, when you come into your closet, you\u2019ll\nquestion this gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to her\ndispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart. But, good\nKate, mock me mercifully; the rather, gentle princess, because I love\nthee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith\nwithin me tells me thou shalt, I get thee with scambling, and thou must\ntherefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I,\nbetween Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half\nEnglish, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the\nbeard? Shall we not? What say\u2019st thou, my fair flower-de-luce?\n\nKATHARINE.\nI do not know dat.\n\nKING HENRY.\nNo; \u2019tis hereafter to know, but now to promise. Do but now promise,\nKate, you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy; and for my\nEnglish moiety, take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer you,\n_la plus belle Katherine du monde, mon tr\u00e8s cher et divin d\u00e9esse?_\n\nKATHARINE.\nYour Majestee \u2019ave _fausse_ French enough to deceive de most _sage\ndemoiselle_ dat is _en France_.\n\nKING HENRY.\nNow, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in true English, I love\nthee, Kate; by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my\nblood begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor and\nuntempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew my father\u2019s ambition! He\nwas thinking of civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created with\na stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when I come to woo\nladies, I fright them. But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better\nI shall appear. My comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of\nbeauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou hast me, if thou hast\nme, at the worst; and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and\nbetter; and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you have me?\nPut off your maiden blushes; avouch the thoughts of your heart with the\nlooks of an empress; take me by the hand, and say, Harry of England, I\nam thine; which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I\nwill tell thee aloud, England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is\nthine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine; who, though I speak it before\nhis face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the\nbest king of good fellows. Come, your answer in broken music; for thy\nvoice is music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of all,\nKatharine, break thy mind to me in broken English. Wilt thou have me?\n\nKATHARINE.\nDat is as it shall please _le roi mon p\u00e8re_.\n\nKING HENRY.\nNay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please him, Kate.\n\nKATHARINE.\nDen it sall also content me.\n\nKING HENRY.\nUpon that I kiss your hand, and call you my queen.\n\nKATHARINE.\n_Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez! Ma foi, je ne veux point que\nvous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main d\u2019une\u2014Notre\nSeigneur!\u2014indigne serviteur. Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon\ntr\u00e8s-puissant seigneur._\n\nKING HENRY.\nThen I will kiss your lips, Kate.\n\nKATHARINE.\n_Les dames et demoiselles pour \u00eatre bais\u00e9es devant leurs noces, il\nn\u2019est pas la coutume de France._\n\nKING HENRY.\nMadame my interpreter, what says she?\n\nALICE.\nDat it is not be de fashion _pour les_ ladies of France,\u2014I cannot tell\nwat is _baiser en_ Anglish.\n\nKING HENRY.\nTo kiss.\n\nALICE.\nYour Majestee _entend_ bettre _que moi_.\n\nKING HENRY.\nIt is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are\nmarried, would she say?\n\nALICE.\n_Oui, vraiment._\n\nKING HENRY.\nO Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot\nbe confined within the weak list of a country\u2019s fashion. We are the\nmakers of manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our places stops\nthe mouth of all find-faults, as I will do yours, for upholding the\nnice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss; therefore, patiently\nand yielding. [_Kissing her._] You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate;\nthere is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of\nthe French council; and they should sooner persuade Harry of England\nthan a general petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.\n\n Enter the French Power and the English Lords.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nGod save your Majesty! My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?\n\nKING HENRY.\nI would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her; and\nthat is good English.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nIs she not apt?\n\nKING HENRY.\nOur tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth; so that,\nhaving neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot\nso conjure up the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in his\ntrue likeness.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nPardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you for that. If you\nwould conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her\nin his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you blame her\nthen, being a maid yet ros\u2019d over with the virgin crimson of modesty,\nif she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing\nself? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.\n\nKING HENRY.\nYet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nThey are then excus\u2019d, my lord, when they see not what they do.\n\nKING HENRY.\nThen, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nI will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will teach her to know\nmy meaning; for maids, well summer\u2019d and warm kept, are like flies at\nBartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their eyes; and then they\nwill endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.\n\nKING HENRY.\nThis moral ties me over to time and a hot summer; and so I shall catch\nthe fly, your cousin, in the latter end, and she must be blind too.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nAs love is, my lord, before it loves.\n\nKING HENRY.\nIt is so; and you may, some of you, thank love for my blindness, who\ncannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands\nin my way.\n\nFRENCH KING.\nYes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities turn\u2019d into a\nmaid; for they are all girdled with maiden walls that no war hath\nentered.\n\nKING HENRY.\nShall Kate be my wife?\n\nFRENCH KING.\nSo please you.\n\nKING HENRY.\nI am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her; so the\nmaid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my\nwill.\n\nFRENCH KING.\nWe have consented to all terms of reason.\n\nKING HENRY.\nIs\u2019t so, my lords of England?\n\nWESTMORLAND.\nThe king hath granted every article;\nHis daughter first, and then in sequel all,\nAccording to their firm proposed natures.\n\nEXETER.\nOnly he hath not yet subscribed this: where your Majesty demands, that\nthe King of France, having any occasion to write for matter of grant,\nshall name your Highness in this form and with this addition, in\nFrench, _Notre tr\u00e8s-cher fils Henri, Roi d\u2019Angleterre, H\u00e9ritier de\nFrance_; and thus in Latin, _Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus,\nrex Angliae et haeres Franciae._\n\nFRENCH KING.\nNor this I have not, brother, so denied\nBut our request shall make me let it pass.\n\nKING HENRY.\nI pray you then, in love and dear alliance,\nLet that one article rank with the rest;\nAnd thereupon give me your daughter.\n\nFRENCH KING.\nTake her, fair son, and from her blood raise up\nIssue to me; that the contending kingdoms\nOf France and England, whose very shores look pale\nWith envy of each other\u2019s happiness,\nMay cease their hatred; and this dear conjunction\nPlant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord\nIn their sweet bosoms, that never war advance\nHis bleeding sword \u2019twixt England and fair France.\n\nLORDS.\nAmen!\n\nKING HENRY.\nNow, welcome, Kate; and bear me witness all,\nThat here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.\n\n [_Flourish._]\n\nQUEEN ISABEL.\nGod, the best maker of all marriages,\nCombine your hearts in one, your realms in one!\nAs man and wife, being two, are one in love,\nSo be there \u2019twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,\nThat never may ill office, or fell jealousy,\nWhich troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,\nThrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,\nTo make divorce of their incorporate league;\nThat English may as French, French Englishmen,\nReceive each other. God speak this Amen!\n\nALL.\nAmen!\n\nKING HENRY.\nPrepare we for our marriage; on which day,\nMy Lord of Burgundy, we\u2019ll take your oath,\nAnd all the peers\u2019, for surety of our leagues,\nThen shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;\nAnd may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!\n\n [_Sennet. Exeunt._]\n\nEPILOGUE.\n\n Enter Chorus.\n\nCHORUS.\nThus far, with rough and all-unable pen,\nOur bending author hath pursu\u2019d the story,\nIn little room confining mighty men,\nMangling by starts the full course of their glory.\nSmall time, but in that small most greatly lived\nThis star of England. Fortune made his sword,\nBy which the world\u2019s best garden he achieved,\nAnd of it left his son imperial lord.\nHenry the Sixth, in infant bands crown\u2019d King\nOf France and England, did this king succeed;\nWhose state so many had the managing,\nThat they lost France and made his England bleed:\nWhich oft our stage hath shown; and, for their sake,\nIn your fair minds let this acceptance take.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\n\n"
