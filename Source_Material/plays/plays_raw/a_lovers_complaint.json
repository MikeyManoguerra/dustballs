"A LOVER\u2019S COMPLAINT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom off a hill whose concave womb reworded\r\nA plaintful story from a sist\u2019ring vale,\r\nMy spirits t\u2019attend this double voice accorded,\r\nAnd down I laid to list the sad-tun\u2019d tale;\r\nEre long espied a fickle maid full pale,\r\nTearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,\r\nStorming her world with sorrow\u2019s wind and rain.\r\n\r\nUpon her head a platted hive of straw,\r\nWhich fortified her visage from the sun,\r\nWhereon the thought might think sometime it saw\r\nThe carcass of a beauty spent and done;\r\nTime had not scythed all that youth begun,\r\nNor youth all quit, but spite of heaven\u2019s fell rage\r\nSome beauty peeped through lattice of sear\u2019d age.\r\n\r\nOft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,\r\nWhich on it had conceited characters,\r\nLaund\u2019ring the silken figures in the brine\r\nThat seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,\r\nAnd often reading what contents it bears;\r\nAs often shrieking undistinguish\u2019d woe,\r\nIn clamours of all size, both high and low.\r\n\r\nSometimes her levell\u2019d eyes their carriage ride,\r\nAs they did batt\u2019ry to the spheres intend;\r\nSometime diverted their poor balls are tied\r\nTo th\u2019orbed earth; sometimes they do extend\r\nTheir view right on; anon their gazes lend\r\nTo every place at once, and nowhere fix\u2019d,\r\nThe mind and sight distractedly commix\u2019d.\r\n\r\nHer hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,\r\nProclaim\u2019d in her a careless hand of pride;\r\nFor some untuck\u2019d descended her sheav\u2019d hat,\r\nHanging her pale and pined cheek beside;\r\nSome in her threaden fillet still did bide,\r\nAnd, true to bondage, would not break from thence,\r\nThough slackly braided in loose negligence.\r\n\r\nA thousand favours from a maund she drew,\r\nOf amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,\r\nWhich one by one she in a river threw,\r\nUpon whose weeping margent she was set,\r\nLike usury applying wet to wet,\r\nOr monarchs\u2019 hands, that lets not bounty fall\r\nWhere want cries \u2018some,\u2019 but where excess begs \u2018all\u2019.\r\n\r\nOf folded schedules had she many a one,\r\nWhich she perus\u2019d, sigh\u2019d, tore and gave the flood;\r\nCrack\u2019d many a ring of posied gold and bone,\r\nBidding them find their sepulchres in mud;\r\nFound yet mo letters sadly penn\u2019d in blood,\r\nWith sleided silk, feat and affectedly\r\nEnswath\u2019d, and seal\u2019d to curious secrecy.\r\n\r\nThese often bath\u2019d she in her fluxive eyes,\r\nAnd often kiss\u2019d, and often gave to tear;\r\nCried, \u2018O false blood, thou register of lies,\r\nWhat unapproved witness dost thou bear!\r\nInk would have seem\u2019d more black and damned here!\u2019\r\nThis said, in top of rage the lines she rents,\r\nBig discontent so breaking their contents.\r\n\r\nA reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,\r\nSometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew\r\nOf court, of city, and had let go by\r\nThe swiftest hours observed as they flew,\r\nTowards this afflicted fancy fastly drew;\r\nAnd, privileg\u2019d by age, desires to know\r\nIn brief the grounds and motives of her woe.\r\n\r\nSo slides he down upon his grained bat,\r\nAnd comely distant sits he by her side,\r\nWhen he again desires her, being sat,\r\nHer grievance with his hearing to divide:\r\nIf that from him there may be aught applied\r\nWhich may her suffering ecstasy assuage,\r\n\u2019Tis promised in the charity of age.\r\n\r\n\u2018Father,\u2019 she says, \u2018though in me you behold\r\nThe injury of many a blasting hour,\r\nLet it not tell your judgement I am old,\r\nNot age, but sorrow, over me hath power.\r\nI might as yet have been a spreading flower,\r\nFresh to myself, if I had self-applied\r\nLove to myself, and to no love beside.\r\n\r\n\u2018But woe is me! Too early I attended\r\nA youthful suit; it was to gain my grace;\r\nO one by nature\u2019s outwards so commended,\r\nThat maiden\u2019s eyes stuck over all his face,\r\nLove lack\u2019d a dwelling and made him her place;\r\nAnd when in his fair parts she did abide,\r\nShe was new lodg\u2019d and newly deified.\r\n\r\n\u2018His browny locks did hang in crooked curls,\r\nAnd every light occasion of the wind\r\nUpon his lips their silken parcels hurls,\r\nWhat\u2019s sweet to do, to do will aptly find,\r\nEach eye that saw him did enchant the mind:\r\nFor on his visage was in little drawn,\r\nWhat largeness thinks in paradise was sawn.\r\n\r\n\u2018Small show of man was yet upon his chin;\r\nHis phoenix down began but to appear,\r\nLike unshorn velvet, on that termless skin,\r\nWhose bare out-bragg\u2019d the web it seemed to wear.\r\nYet show\u2019d his visage by that cost more dear,\r\nAnd nice affections wavering stood in doubt\r\nIf best were as it was, or best without.\r\n\r\n\u2018His qualities were beauteous as his form,\r\nFor maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;\r\nYet if men mov\u2019d him, was he such a storm\r\nAs oft \u2019twixt May and April is to see,\r\nWhen winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.\r\nHis rudeness so with his authoriz\u2019d youth\r\nDid livery falseness in a pride of truth.\r\n\r\n\u2018Well could he ride, and often men would say\r\nThat horse his mettle from his rider takes,\r\nProud of subjection, noble by the sway,\r\nWhat rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!\r\nAnd controversy hence a question takes,\r\nWhether the horse by him became his deed,\r\nOr he his manage by th\u2019 well-doing steed.\r\n\r\n\u2018But quickly on this side the verdict went,\r\nHis real habitude gave life and grace\r\nTo appertainings and to ornament,\r\nAccomplish\u2019d in himself, not in his case;\r\nAll aids, themselves made fairer by their place,\r\nCame for additions; yet their purpos\u2019d trim\r\nPiec\u2019d not his grace, but were all grac\u2019d by him.\r\n\r\n\u2018So on the tip of his subduing tongue\r\nAll kind of arguments and question deep,\r\nAll replication prompt, and reason strong,\r\nFor his advantage still did wake and sleep,\r\nTo make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep:\r\nHe had the dialect and different skill,\r\nCatching all passions in his craft of will.\r\n\r\n\u2018That he did in the general bosom reign\r\nOf young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,\r\nTo dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain\r\nIn personal duty, following where he haunted,\r\nConsent\u2019s bewitch\u2019d, ere he desire, have granted,\r\nAnd dialogued for him what he would say,\r\nAsk\u2019d their own wills, and made their wills obey.\r\n\r\n\u2018Many there were that did his picture get\r\nTo serve their eyes, and in it put their mind,\r\nLike fools that in th\u2019 imagination set\r\nThe goodly objects which abroad they find\r\nOf lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign\u2019d,\r\nAnd labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them,\r\nThan the true gouty landlord which doth owe them.\r\n\r\n\u2018So many have, that never touch\u2019d his hand,\r\nSweetly suppos\u2019d them mistress of his heart.\r\nMy woeful self that did in freedom stand,\r\nAnd was my own fee-simple (not in part)\r\nWhat with his art in youth, and youth in art,\r\nThrew my affections in his charmed power,\r\nReserv\u2019d the stalk and gave him all my flower.\r\n\r\n\u2018Yet did I not, as some my equals did,\r\nDemand of him, nor being desired yielded,\r\nFinding myself in honour so forbid,\r\nWith safest distance I mine honour shielded.\r\nExperience for me many bulwarks builded\r\nOf proofs new-bleeding, which remain\u2019d the foil\r\nOf this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.\r\n\r\n\u2018But ah! Who ever shunn\u2019d by precedent\r\nThe destin\u2019d ill she must herself assay,\r\nOr force\u2019d examples \u2019gainst her own content,\r\nTo put the by-pass\u2019d perils in her way?\r\nCounsel may stop a while what will not stay:\r\nFor when we rage, advice is often seen\r\nBy blunting us to make our wills more keen.\r\n\r\n\u2018Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,\r\nThat we must curb it upon others\u2019 proof,\r\nTo be forbode the sweets that seems so good,\r\nFor fear of harms that preach in our behoof.\r\nO appetite, from judgement stand aloof!\r\nThe one a palate hath that needs will taste,\r\nThough reason weep and cry, \u201cIt is thy last.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2018For further I could say, \u201cThis man\u2019s untrue\u201d,\r\nAnd knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;\r\nHeard where his plants in others\u2019 orchards grew,\r\nSaw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;\r\nKnew vows were ever brokers to defiling;\r\nThought characters and words merely but art,\r\nAnd bastards of his foul adulterate heart.\r\n\r\n\u2018And long upon these terms I held my city,\r\nTill thus he \u2019gan besiege me: \u201cGentle maid,\r\nHave of my suffering youth some feeling pity,\r\nAnd be not of my holy vows afraid:\r\nThat\u2019s to ye sworn, to none was ever said,\r\nFor feasts of love I have been call\u2019d unto,\r\nTill now did ne\u2019er invite, nor never woo.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cAll my offences that abroad you see\r\nAre errors of the blood, none of the mind:\r\nLove made them not; with acture they may be,\r\nWhere neither party is nor true nor kind,\r\nThey sought their shame that so their shame did find,\r\nAnd so much less of shame in me remains,\r\nBy how much of me their reproach contains.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cAmong the many that mine eyes have seen,\r\nNot one whose flame my heart so much as warmed,\r\nOr my affection put to th\u2019 smallest teen,\r\nOr any of my leisures ever charmed:\r\nHarm have I done to them, but ne\u2019er was harmed;\r\nKept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,\r\nAnd reign\u2019d commanding in his monarchy.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cLook here what tributes wounded fancies sent me,\r\nOf pallid pearls and rubies red as blood,\r\nFiguring that they their passions likewise lent me\r\nOf grief and blushes, aptly understood\r\nIn bloodless white and the encrimson\u2019d mood;\r\nEffects of terror and dear modesty,\r\nEncamp\u2019d in hearts, but fighting outwardly.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cAnd, lo! behold these talents of their hair,\r\nWith twisted metal amorously empleach\u2019d,\r\nI have receiv\u2019d from many a several fair,\r\nTheir kind acceptance weepingly beseech\u2019d,\r\nWith th\u2019 annexions of fair gems enrich\u2019d,\r\nAnd deep-brain\u2019d sonnets that did amplify\r\nEach stone\u2019s dear nature, worth and quality.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cThe diamond, why \u2019twas beautiful and hard,\r\nWhereto his invis\u2019d properties did tend,\r\nThe deep green emerald, in whose fresh regard\r\nWeak sights their sickly radiance do amend;\r\nThe heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend\r\nWith objects manifold; each several stone,\r\nWith wit well blazon\u2019d smil\u2019d, or made some moan.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cLo, all these trophies of affections hot,\r\nOf pensiv\u2019d and subdued desires the tender,\r\nNature hath charg\u2019d me that I hoard them not,\r\nBut yield them up where I myself must render,\r\nThat is, to you, my origin and ender:\r\nFor these of force must your oblations be,\r\nSince I their altar, you empatron me.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cO then advance of yours that phraseless hand,\r\nWhose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;\r\nTake all these similes to your own command,\r\nHallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise:\r\nWhat me, your minister for you, obeys,\r\nWorks under you; and to your audit comes\r\nTheir distract parcels in combined sums.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cLo, this device was sent me from a nun,\r\nOr sister sanctified of holiest note,\r\nWhich late her noble suit in court did shun,\r\nWhose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;\r\nFor she was sought by spirits of richest coat,\r\nBut kept cold distance, and did thence remove\r\nTo spend her living in eternal love.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cBut O, my sweet, what labour is\u2019t to leave\r\nThe thing we have not, mast\u2019ring what not strives,\r\nPlaning the place which did no form receive,\r\nPlaying patient sports in unconstrained gyves,\r\nShe that her fame so to herself contrives,\r\nThe scars of battle \u2019scapeth by the flight,\r\nAnd makes her absence valiant, not her might.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cO pardon me, in that my boast is true,\r\nThe accident which brought me to her eye,\r\nUpon the moment did her force subdue,\r\nAnd now she would the caged cloister fly:\r\nReligious love put out religion\u2019s eye:\r\nNot to be tempted would she be immur\u2019d,\r\nAnd now to tempt all, liberty procur\u2019d.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cHow mighty then you are, O hear me tell!\r\nThe broken bosoms that to me belong\r\nHave emptied all their fountains in my well,\r\nAnd mine I pour your ocean all among:\r\nI strong o\u2019er them, and you o\u2019er me being strong,\r\nMust for your victory us all congest,\r\nAs compound love to physic your cold breast.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cMy parts had pow\u2019r to charm a sacred nun,\r\nWho, disciplin\u2019d and dieted in grace,\r\nBeliev\u2019d her eyes when they t\u2019assail begun,\r\nAll vows and consecrations giving place.\r\nO most potential love! Vow, bond, nor space,\r\nIn thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,\r\nFor thou art all and all things else are thine.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cWhen thou impressest, what are precepts worth\r\nOf stale example? When thou wilt inflame,\r\nHow coldly those impediments stand forth,\r\nOf wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!\r\nLove\u2019s arms are peace, \u2019gainst rule, \u2019gainst sense, \u2019gainst shame,\r\nAnd sweetens, in the suff\u2019ring pangs it bears,\r\nThe aloes of all forces, shocks and fears.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u201cNow all these hearts that do on mine depend,\r\nFeeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine,\r\nAnd supplicant their sighs to your extend,\r\nTo leave the batt\u2019ry that you make \u2019gainst mine,\r\nLending soft audience to my sweet design,\r\nAnd credent soul to that strong-bonded oath,\r\nThat shall prefer and undertake my troth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2018This said, his wat\u2019ry eyes he did dismount,\r\nWhose sights till then were levell\u2019d on my face;\r\nEach cheek a river running from a fount\r\nWith brinish current downward flowed apace.\r\nO how the channel to the stream gave grace!\r\nWho, glaz\u2019d with crystal gate the glowing roses\r\nThat flame through water which their hue encloses.\r\n\r\n\u2018O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies\r\nIn the small orb of one particular tear!\r\nBut with the inundation of the eyes\r\nWhat rocky heart to water will not wear?\r\nWhat breast so cold that is not warmed here?\r\nO cleft effect! Cold modesty, hot wrath,\r\nBoth fire from hence and chill extincture hath.\r\n\r\n\u2018For lo, his passion, but an art of craft,\r\nEven there resolv\u2019d my reason into tears;\r\nThere my white stole of chastity I daff\u2019d,\r\nShook off my sober guards, and civil fears,\r\nAppear to him as he to me appears,\r\nAll melting, though our drops this diff\u2019rence bore:\r\nHis poison\u2019d me, and mine did him restore.\r\n\r\n\u2018In him a plenitude of subtle matter,\r\nApplied to cautels, all strange forms receives,\r\nOf burning blushes, or of weeping water,\r\nOr swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,\r\nIn either\u2019s aptness, as it best deceives,\r\nTo blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,\r\nOr to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.\r\n\r\n\u2018That not a heart which in his level came\r\nCould \u2019scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,\r\nShowing fair nature is both kind and tame;\r\nAnd veil\u2019d in them, did win whom he would maim.\r\nAgainst the thing he sought he would exclaim;\r\nWhen he most burned in heart-wish\u2019d luxury,\r\nHe preach\u2019d pure maid, and prais\u2019d cold chastity.\r\n\r\n\u2018Thus merely with the garment of a grace,\r\nThe naked and concealed fiend he cover\u2019d,\r\nThat th\u2019unexperient gave the tempter place,\r\nWhich, like a cherubin, above them hover\u2019d.\r\nWho, young and simple, would not be so lover\u2019d?\r\nAy me! I fell, and yet do question make\r\nWhat I should do again for such a sake.\r\n\r\n\u2018O, that infected moisture of his eye,\r\nO, that false fire which in his cheek so glow\u2019d!\r\nO, that forc\u2019d thunder from his heart did fly,\r\nO, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow\u2019d,\r\nO, all that borrowed motion, seeming owed,\r\nWould yet again betray the fore-betrayed,\r\nAnd new pervert a reconciled maid.\u2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r"
