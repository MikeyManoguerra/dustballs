One dead, or drunk?\nSee, doth he breathe?\n\nSECOND HUNTSMAN.\nHe breathes, my lord.

A bedchamber in the LORD\u2019S house.\n\nSly is discovered in a rich nightgown, with Attendants: some with\napparel, basin, ewer, and other appurtenances; and Lord, dressed like a\nservant.\n\nSLY.\nFor God\u2019s sake! a pot of small ale.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nWill\u2019t please your lordship drink a cup of sack?\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nWill\u2019t please your honour taste of these conserves?\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nWhat raiment will your honour wear today?\n\nSLY.\nI am Christophero Sly; call not me honour nor lordship. I ne\u2019er drank\nsack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of\nbeef. Ne\u2019er ask me what raiment I\u2019ll wear, for I have no more doublets\nthan backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet:\nnay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look\nthrough the over-leather.\n\nLORD.\nHeaven cease this idle humour in your honour!\nO, that a mighty man of such descent,\nOf such possessions, and so high esteem,\nShould be infused with so foul a spirit!\n\nSLY.\nWhat! would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly\u2019s son of\nBurton-heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by\ntransmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask\nMarian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not: if she\nsay I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for\nthe lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not bestraught. Here\u2019s\u2014\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nO! this it is that makes your lady mourn.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nO! this is it that makes your servants droop.\n\nLORD.\nHence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,\nAs beaten hence by your strange lunacy.\nO noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,\nCall home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,\nAnd banish hence these abject lowly dreams.\nLook how thy servants do attend on thee,\nEach in his office ready at thy beck:\nWilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,\n\n[_Music._]\n\nAnd twenty caged nightingales do sing:\nOr wilt thou sleep? We\u2019ll have thee to a couch\nSofter and sweeter than the lustful bed\nOn purpose trimm\u2019d up for Semiramis.\nSay thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground:\nOr wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp\u2019d,\nTheir harness studded all with gold and pearl.\nDost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar\nAbove the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt?\nThy hounds shall make the welkin answer them\nAnd fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nSay thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift\nAs breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nDost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight\nAdonis painted by a running brook,\nAnd Cytherea all in sedges hid,\nWhich seem to move and wanton with her breath\nEven as the waving sedges play with wind.\n\nLORD.\nWe\u2019ll show thee Io as she was a maid\nAnd how she was beguiled and surpris\u2019d,\nAs lively painted as the deed was done.\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nOr Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,\nScratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds\nAnd at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,\nSo workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.\n\nLORD.\nThou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:\nThou hast a lady far more beautiful\nThan any woman in this waning age.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nAnd, till the tears that she hath shed for thee\nLike envious floods o\u2019er-run her lovely face,\nShe was the fairest creature in the world;\nAnd yet she is inferior to none.\n\nSLY.\nAm I a lord? and have I such a lady?\nOr do I dream? Or have I dream\u2019d till now?\nI do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;\nI smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things:\nUpon my life, I am a lord indeed;\nAnd not a tinker, nor Christophero Sly.\nWell, bring our lady hither to our sight;\nAnd once again, a pot o\u2019 the smallest ale.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nWill\u2019t please your mightiness to wash your hands?\n\n[_Servants present a ewer, basin and napkin._]\n\nO, how we joy to see your wit restor\u2019d!\nO, that once more you knew but what you are!\nThese fifteen years you have been in a dream,\nOr, when you wak\u2019d, so wak\u2019d as if you slept.\n\nSLY.\nThese fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.\nBut did I never speak of all that time?\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nO! yes, my lord, but very idle words;\nFor though you lay here in this goodly chamber,\nYet would you say ye were beaten out of door,\nAnd rail upon the hostess of the house,\nAnd say you would present her at the leet,\nBecause she brought stone jugs and no seal\u2019d quarts.\nSometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.\n\nSLY.\nAy, the woman\u2019s maid of the house.\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nWhy, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,\nNor no such men as you have reckon\u2019d up,\nAs Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,\nAnd Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;\nAnd twenty more such names and men as these,\nWhich never were, nor no man ever saw.\n\nSLY.\nNow, Lord be thanked for my good amends!\n\nALL.\nAmen.\n\n\nEnter the Page, as a lady, with Attendants.\n\nSLY.\nI thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.\n\nPAGE.\nHow fares my noble lord?\n\nSLY.\nMarry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.\nWhere is my wife?\n\nPAGE.\nHere, noble lord: what is thy will with her?\n\nSLY.\nAre you my wife, and will not call me husband?\nMy men should call me lord: I am your goodman.\n\nPAGE.\nMy husband and my lord, my lord and husband;\nI am your wife in all obedience.\n\nSLY.\nI know it well. What must I call her?\n\nLORD.\nMadam.\n\nSLY.\nAlice madam, or Joan madam?\n\nLORD.\nMadam, and nothing else; so lords call ladies.\n\nSLY.\nMadam wife, they say that I have dream\u2019d\nAnd slept above some fifteen year or more.\n\nPAGE.\nAy, and the time seems thirty unto me,\nBeing all this time abandon\u2019d from your bed.\n\nSLY.\n\u2019Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.\nMadam, undress you, and come now to bed.\n\nPAGE.\nThrice noble lord, let me entreat of you\nTo pardon me yet for a night or two;\nOr, if not so, until the sun be set:\nFor your physicians have expressly charg\u2019d,\nIn peril to incur your former malady,\nThat I should yet absent me from your bed:\nI hope this reason stands for my excuse.\n\nSLY.\nAy, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long; but I would be loath\nto fall into my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in despite of the\nflesh and the blood.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nYour honour\u2019s players, hearing your amendment,\nAre come to play a pleasant comedy;\nFor so your doctors hold it very meet,\nSeeing too much sadness hath congeal\u2019d your blood,\nAnd melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:\nTherefore they thought it good you hear a play,\nAnd frame your mind to mirth and merriment,\nWhich bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.\n\nSLY.\nMarry, I will; let them play it. Is not a commonty a Christmas gambold\nor a tumbling-trick?\n\nPAGE.\nNo, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.\n\nSLY.\nWhat! household stuff?\n\nPAGE.\nIt is a kind of history.\n\nSLY.\nWell, we\u2019ll see\u2019t. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let the world\nslip: we shall ne\u2019er be younger.\n\n\n\n"}, "body": [[{"title": "the taming of the shrew", "author_first_name": "william", "author_last_name": "shakespeare", "act": 1, "scene": 1, "direction": "\nFlourish.
