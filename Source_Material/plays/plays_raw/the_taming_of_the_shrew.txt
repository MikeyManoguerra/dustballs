Therefore, _paucas pallabris_; let the\nworld slide. Sessa!\n\nHOSTESS.\nYou will not pay for the glasses you have burst?\n\nSLY.\nNo, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed and warm\nthee.\n\nHOSTESS.\nI know my remedy; I must go fetch the third-borough.\n\n[_Exit_]\n\nSLY.\nThird, or fourth, or fifth borough, I\u2019ll answer him by law.

Enter a Lord from hunting, with Huntsmen and Servants.\n\nLORD.\nHuntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;\nBrach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss\u2019d,\nAnd couple Clowder with the deep-mouth\u2019d brach.\nSaw\u2019st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good\nAt the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?\nI would not lose the dog for twenty pound.\n\nFIRST HUNTSMAN.\nWhy, Bellman is as good as he, my lord;\nHe cried upon it at the merest loss,\nAnd twice today pick\u2019d out the dullest scent;\nTrust me, I take him for the better dog.\n\nLORD.\nThou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,\nI would esteem him worth a dozen such.\nBut sup them well, and look unto them all;\nTomorrow I intend to hunt again.\n\nFIRST HUNTSMAN.\nI will, my lord.\n\nLORD.\n[ _Sees Sly_.] What\u2019s here? One dead, or drunk?\nSee, doth he breathe?\n\nSECOND HUNTSMAN.\nHe breathes, my lord. Were he not warm\u2019d with ale,\nThis were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.\n\nLORD.\nO monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!\nGrim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!\nSirs, I will practise on this drunken man.\nWhat think you, if he were convey\u2019d to bed,\nWrapp\u2019d in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,\nA most delicious banquet by his bed,\nAnd brave attendants near him when he wakes,\nWould not the beggar then forget himself?\n\nFIRST HUNTSMAN.\nBelieve me, lord, I think he cannot choose.\n\nSECOND HUNTSMAN.\nIt would seem strange unto him when he wak\u2019d.\n\nLORD.\nEven as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.\nThen take him up, and manage well the jest.\nCarry him gently to my fairest chamber,\nAnd hang it round with all my wanton pictures;\nBalm his foul head in warm distilled waters,\nAnd burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet.\nProcure me music ready when he wakes,\nTo make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;\nAnd if he chance to speak, be ready straight,\nAnd with a low submissive reverence\nSay \u2018What is it your honour will command?\u2019\nLet one attend him with a silver basin\nFull of rose-water and bestrew\u2019d with flowers;\nAnother bear the ewer, the third a diaper,\nAnd say \u2018Will\u2019t please your lordship cool your hands?\u2019\nSomeone be ready with a costly suit,\nAnd ask him what apparel he will wear;\nAnother tell him of his hounds and horse,\nAnd that his lady mourns at his disease.\nPersuade him that he hath been lunatic;\nAnd, when he says he is\u2014say that he dreams,\nFor he is nothing but a mighty lord.\nThis do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;\nIt will be pastime passing excellent,\nIf it be husbanded with modesty.\n\nFIRST HUNTSMAN.\nMy lord, I warrant you we will play our part,\nAs he shall think by our true diligence,\nHe is no less than what we say he is.\n\nLORD.\nTake him up gently, and to bed with him,\nAnd each one to his office when he wakes.\n\n[Sly _is bourne out.

This fellow I remember\nSince once he play\u2019d a farmer\u2019s eldest son;\n\u2019Twas where you woo\u2019d the gentlewoman so well.\nI have forgot your name; but, sure, that part\nWas aptly fitted and naturally perform\u2019d.\n\nPLAYER.\nI think \u2019twas Soto that your honour means.\n\nLORD.\n\u2019Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.\nWell, you are come to me in happy time,\nThe rather for I have some sport in hand\nWherein your cunning can assist me much.\nThere is a lord will hear you play tonight;\nBut I am doubtful of your modesties,\nLest, over-eying of his odd behaviour,\u2014\nFor yet his honour never heard a play,\u2014\nYou break into some merry passion\nAnd so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,\nIf you should smile, he grows impatient.\n\nPLAYER.\nFear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves,\nWere he the veriest antick in the world.\n\nLORD.\nGo, sirrah, take them to the buttery,\nAnd give them friendly welcome everyone:\nLet them want nothing that my house affords.\n\n[_Exit one with the Players._]\n\nSirrah, go you to Barthol\u2019mew my page,\nAnd see him dress\u2019d in all suits like a lady;\nThat done, conduct him to the drunkard\u2019s chamber,\nAnd call him \u2018madam,\u2019 do him obeisance.\nTell him from me\u2014as he will win my love,\u2014\nHe bear himself with honourable action,\nSuch as he hath observ\u2019d in noble ladies\nUnto their lords, by them accomplished;\nSuch duty to the drunkard let him do,\nWith soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,\nAnd say \u2018What is\u2019t your honour will command,\nWherein your lady and your humble wife\nMay show her duty and make known her love?\u2019\nAnd then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,\nAnd with declining head into his bosom,\nBid him shed tears, as being overjoy\u2019d\nTo see her noble lord restor\u2019d to health,\nWho for this seven years hath esteemed him\nNo better than a poor and loathsome beggar.\nAnd if the boy have not a woman\u2019s gift\nTo rain a shower of commanded tears,\nAn onion will do well for such a shift,\nWhich, in a napkin being close convey\u2019d,\nShall in despite enforce a watery eye.\nSee this dispatch\u2019d with all the haste thou canst;\nAnon I\u2019ll give thee more instructions.\n\n[_Exit Servant._]\n\nI know the boy will well usurp the grace,\nVoice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman;\nI long to hear him call the drunkard husband;\nAnd how my men will stay themselves from laughter\nWhen they do homage to this simple peasant.\nI\u2019ll in to counsel them; haply my presence\nMay well abate the over-merry spleen,\nWhich otherwise would grow into extremes.\n\n[_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II. A bedchamber in the LORD\u2019S house.\n\nSly is discovered in a rich nightgown, with Attendants: some with\napparel, basin, ewer, and other appurtenances; and Lord, dressed like a\nservant.\n\nSLY.\nFor God\u2019s sake! a pot of small ale.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nWill\u2019t please your lordship drink a cup of sack?\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nWill\u2019t please your honour taste of these conserves?\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nWhat raiment will your honour wear today?\n\nSLY.\nI am Christophero Sly; call not me honour nor lordship. I ne\u2019er drank\nsack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of\nbeef. Ne\u2019er ask me what raiment I\u2019ll wear, for I have no more doublets\nthan backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet:\nnay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look\nthrough the over-leather.\n\nLORD.\nHeaven cease this idle humour in your honour!\nO, that a mighty man of such descent,\nOf such possessions, and so high esteem,\nShould be infused with so foul a spirit!\n\nSLY.\nWhat! would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly\u2019s son of\nBurton-heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by\ntransmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask\nMarian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not: if she\nsay I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for\nthe lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not bestraught. Here\u2019s\u2014\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nO! this it is that makes your lady mourn.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nO! this is it that makes your servants droop.\n\nLORD.\nHence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,\nAs beaten hence by your strange lunacy.\nO noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,\nCall home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,\nAnd banish hence these abject lowly dreams.\nLook how thy servants do attend on thee,\nEach in his office ready at thy beck:\nWilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,\n\n[_Music._]\n\nAnd twenty caged nightingales do sing:\nOr wilt thou sleep? We\u2019ll have thee to a couch\nSofter and sweeter than the lustful bed\nOn purpose trimm\u2019d up for Semiramis.\nSay thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground:\nOr wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp\u2019d,\nTheir harness studded all with gold and pearl.\nDost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar\nAbove the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt?\nThy hounds shall make the welkin answer them\nAnd fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nSay thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift\nAs breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nDost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight\nAdonis painted by a running brook,\nAnd Cytherea all in sedges hid,\nWhich seem to move and wanton with her breath\nEven as the waving sedges play with wind.\n\nLORD.\nWe\u2019ll show thee Io as she was a maid\nAnd how she was beguiled and surpris\u2019d,\nAs lively painted as the deed was done.\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nOr Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,\nScratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds\nAnd at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,\nSo workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.\n\nLORD.\nThou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:\nThou hast a lady far more beautiful\nThan any woman in this waning age.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nAnd, till the tears that she hath shed for thee\nLike envious floods o\u2019er-run her lovely face,\nShe was the fairest creature in the world;\nAnd yet she is inferior to none.\n\nSLY.\nAm I a lord? and have I such a lady?\nOr do I dream? Or have I dream\u2019d till now?\nI do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;\nI smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things:\nUpon my life, I am a lord indeed;\nAnd not a tinker, nor Christophero Sly.\nWell, bring our lady hither to our sight;\nAnd once again, a pot o\u2019 the smallest ale.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nWill\u2019t please your mightiness to wash your hands?\n\n[_Servants present a ewer, basin and napkin._]\n\nO, how we joy to see your wit restor\u2019d!\nO, that once more you knew but what you are!\nThese fifteen years you have been in a dream,\nOr, when you wak\u2019d, so wak\u2019d as if you slept.\n\nSLY.\nThese fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.\nBut did I never speak of all that time?\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nO! yes, my lord, but very idle words;\nFor though you lay here in this goodly chamber,\nYet would you say ye were beaten out of door,\nAnd rail upon the hostess of the house,\nAnd say you would present her at the leet,\nBecause she brought stone jugs and no seal\u2019d quarts.\nSometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.\n\nSLY.\nAy, the woman\u2019s maid of the house.\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nWhy, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,\nNor no such men as you have reckon\u2019d up,\nAs Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,\nAnd Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;\nAnd twenty more such names and men as these,\nWhich never were, nor no man ever saw.\n\nSLY.\nNow, Lord be thanked for my good amends!\n\nALL.\nAmen.\n\n\nEnter the Page, as a lady, with Attendants.\n\nSLY.\nI thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.\n\nPAGE.\nHow fares my noble lord?\n\nSLY.\nMarry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.\nWhere is my wife?\n\nPAGE.\nHere, noble lord: what is thy will with her?\n\nSLY.\nAre you my wife, and will not call me husband?\nMy men should call me lord: I am your goodman.\n\nPAGE.\nMy husband and my lord, my lord and husband;\nI am your wife in all obedience.\n\nSLY.\nI know it well. What must I call her?\n\nLORD.\nMadam.\n\nSLY.\nAlice madam, or Joan madam?\n\nLORD.\nMadam, and nothing else; so lords call ladies.\n\nSLY.\nMadam wife, they say that I have dream\u2019d\nAnd slept above some fifteen year or more.\n\nPAGE.\nAy, and the time seems thirty unto me,\nBeing all this time abandon\u2019d from your bed.\n\nSLY.\n\u2019Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.\nMadam, undress you, and come now to bed.\n\nPAGE.\nThrice noble lord, let me entreat of you\nTo pardon me yet for a night or two;\nOr, if not so, until the sun be set:\nFor your physicians have expressly charg\u2019d,\nIn peril to incur your former malady,\nThat I should yet absent me from your bed:\nI hope this reason stands for my excuse.\n\nSLY.\nAy, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long; but I would be loath\nto fall into my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in despite of the\nflesh and the blood.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nYour honour\u2019s players, hearing your amendment,\nAre come to play a pleasant comedy;\nFor so your doctors hold it very meet,\nSeeing too much sadness hath congeal\u2019d your blood,\nAnd melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:\nTherefore they thought it good you hear a play,\nAnd frame your mind to mirth and merriment,\nWhich bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.\n\nSLY.\nMarry, I will; let them play it. Is not a commonty a Christmas gambold\nor a tumbling-trick?\n\nPAGE.\nNo, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.\n\nSLY.\nWhat! household stuff?\n\nPAGE.\nIt is a kind of history.\n\nSLY.\nWell, we\u2019ll see\u2019t. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let the world\nslip: we shall ne\u2019er be younger.\n\n\n\n\nACT I. SCENE I. Padua. A public place.\n\nFlourish. Enter Lucentio and Tranio.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTranio, since for the great desire I had\nTo see fair Padua, nursery of arts,\nI am arriv\u2019d for fruitful Lombardy,\nThe pleasant garden of great Italy,\nAnd by my father\u2019s love and leave am arm\u2019d\nWith his good will and thy good company,\nMy trusty servant well approv\u2019d in all,\nHere let us breathe, and haply institute\nA course of learning and ingenious studies.\nPisa, renowned for grave citizens,\nGave me my being and my father first,\nA merchant of great traffic through the world,\nVincentio, come of the Bentivolii.\nVincentio\u2019s son, brought up in Florence,\nIt shall become to serve all hopes conceiv\u2019d,\nTo deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:\nAnd therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,\nVirtue and that part of philosophy\nWill I apply that treats of happiness\nBy virtue specially to be achiev\u2019d.\nTell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left\nAnd am to Padua come as he that leaves\nA shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,\nAnd with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.\n\nTRANIO.\n_Mi perdonato_, gentle master mine;\nI am in all affected as yourself;\nGlad that you thus continue your resolve\nTo suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.\nOnly, good master, while we do admire\nThis virtue and this moral discipline,\nLet\u2019s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;\nOr so devote to Aristotle\u2019s checks\nAs Ovid be an outcast quite abjur\u2019d.\nBalk logic with acquaintance that you have,\nAnd practise rhetoric in your common talk;\nMusic and poesy use to quicken you;\nThe mathematics and the metaphysics,\nFall to them as you find your stomach serves you:\nNo profit grows where is no pleasure ta\u2019en;\nIn brief, sir, study what you most affect.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nGramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.\nIf, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,\nWe could at once put us in readiness,\nAnd take a lodging fit to entertain\nSuch friends as time in Padua shall beget.\nBut stay awhile; what company is this?\n\nTRANIO.\nMaster, some show to welcome us to town.\n\n[_Lucentio and Tranio stand aside._]\n\nEnter Baptista, Katherina, Bianca, Gremio and Hortensio.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nGentlemen, importune me no farther,\nFor how I firmly am resolv\u2019d you know;\nThat is, not to bestow my youngest daughter\nBefore I have a husband for the elder.\nIf either of you both love Katherina,\nBecause I know you well and love you well,\nLeave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.\n\nGREMIO.\nTo cart her rather: she\u2019s too rough for me.\nThere, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?\n\nKATHERINA.\n[_To Baptista_] I pray you, sir, is it your will\nTo make a stale of me amongst these mates?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nMates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,\nUnless you were of gentler, milder mould.\n\nKATHERINA.\nI\u2019 faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;\nI wis it is not half way to her heart;\nBut if it were, doubt not her care should be\nTo comb your noddle with a three-legg\u2019d stool,\nAnd paint your face, and use you like a fool.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nFrom all such devils, good Lord deliver us!\n\nGREMIO.\nAnd me, too, good Lord!\n\nTRANIO.\nHusht, master! Here\u2019s some good pastime toward:\nThat wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nBut in the other\u2019s silence do I see\nMaid\u2019s mild behaviour and sobriety.\nPeace, Tranio!\n\nTRANIO.\nWell said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nGentlemen, that I may soon make good\nWhat I have said,\u2014Bianca, get you in:\nAnd let it not displease thee, good Bianca,\nFor I will love thee ne\u2019er the less, my girl.\n\nKATHERINA.\nA pretty peat! it is best put finger in the eye, and she knew why.\n\nBIANCA.\nSister, content you in my discontent.\nSir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:\nMy books and instruments shall be my company,\nOn them to look, and practise by myself.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nHark, Tranio! thou mayst hear Minerva speak.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSignior Baptista, will you be so strange?\nSorry am I that our good will effects\nBianca\u2019s grief.\n\nGREMIO.\nWhy will you mew her up,\nSignior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,\nAnd make her bear the penance of her tongue?\n\nBAPTISTA.\nGentlemen, content ye; I am resolv\u2019d.\nGo in, Bianca.\n\n[_Exit Bianca._]\n\nAnd for I know she taketh most delight\nIn music, instruments, and poetry,\nSchoolmasters will I keep within my house\nFit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,\nOr, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,\nPrefer them hither; for to cunning men\nI will be very kind, and liberal\nTo mine own children in good bringing up;\nAnd so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;\nFor I have more to commune with Bianca.\n\n[_Exit._]\n\nKATHERINA.\nWhy, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What! shall I be appointed\nhours, as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave?\nHa!\n\n[_Exit._]\n\nGREMIO.\nYou may go to the devil\u2019s dam: your gifts are so good here\u2019s none will\nhold you. Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our\nnails together, and fast it fairly out; our cake\u2019s dough on both sides.\nFarewell: yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any\nmeans light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will\nwish him to her father.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSo will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. Though the nature of our\nquarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us\nboth,\u2014that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be\nhappy rivals in Bianca\u2019s love,\u2014to labour and effect one thing\nspecially.\n\nGREMIO.\nWhat\u2019s that, I pray?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nMarry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.\n\nGREMIO.\nA husband! a devil.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nI say, a husband.\n\nGREMIO.\nI say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her father be very\nrich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nTush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud\nalarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, and a man could\nlight on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.\n\nGREMIO.\nI cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to\nbe whipp\u2019d at the high cross every morning.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nFaith, as you say, there\u2019s small choice in rotten apples. But come;\nsince this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth\nfriendly maintained, till by helping Baptista\u2019s eldest daughter to a\nhusband, we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to\u2019t\nafresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets\nthe ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?\n\nGREMIO.\nI am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin\nhis wooing, that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and\nrid the house of her. Come on.\n\n[_Exeunt Gremio and Hortensio._]\n\nTRANIO.\nI pray, sir, tell me, is it possible\nThat love should of a sudden take such hold?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nO Tranio! till I found it to be true,\nI never thought it possible or likely;\nBut see, while idly I stood looking on,\nI found the effect of love in idleness;\nAnd now in plainness do confess to thee,\nThat art to me as secret and as dear\nAs Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,\nTranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,\nIf I achieve not this young modest girl.\nCounsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst:\nAssist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.\n\nTRANIO.\nMaster, it is no time to chide you now;\nAffection is not rated from the heart:\nIf love have touch\u2019d you, nought remains but so:\n_Redime te captum quam queas minimo._\n\nLUCENTIO.\nGramercies, lad; go forward; this contents;\nThe rest will comfort, for thy counsel\u2019s sound.\n\nTRANIO.\nMaster, you look\u2019d so longly on the maid.\nPerhaps you mark\u2019d not what\u2019s the pith of all.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nO, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,\nSuch as the daughter of Agenor had,\nThat made great Jove to humble him to her hand,\nWhen with his knees he kiss\u2019d the Cretan strand.\n\nTRANIO.\nSaw you no more? mark\u2019d you not how her sister\nBegan to scold and raise up such a storm\nThat mortal ears might hardly endure the din?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTranio, I saw her coral lips to move,\nAnd with her breath she did perfume the air;\nSacred and sweet was all I saw in her.\n\nTRANIO.\nNay, then, \u2019tis time to stir him from his trance.\nI pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,\nBend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:\nHer elder sister is so curst and shrewd,\nThat till the father rid his hands of her,\nMaster, your love must live a maid at home;\nAnd therefore has he closely mew\u2019d her up,\nBecause she will not be annoy\u2019d with suitors.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nAh, Tranio, what a cruel father\u2019s he!\nBut art thou not advis\u2019d he took some care\nTo get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?\n\nTRANIO.\nAy, marry, am I, sir, and now \u2019tis plotted.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nI have it, Tranio.\n\nTRANIO.\nMaster, for my hand,\nBoth our inventions meet and jump in one.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTell me thine first.\n\nTRANIO.\nYou will be schoolmaster,\nAnd undertake the teaching of the maid:\nThat\u2019s your device.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nIt is: may it be done?\n\nTRANIO.\nNot possible; for who shall bear your part\nAnd be in Padua here Vincentio\u2019s son;\nKeep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;\nVisit his countrymen, and banquet them?\n\nLUCENTIO.\n_Basta_, content thee, for I have it full.\nWe have not yet been seen in any house,\nNor can we be distinguish\u2019d by our faces\nFor man or master: then it follows thus:\nThou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,\nKeep house and port and servants, as I should;\nI will some other be; some Florentine,\nSome Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.\n\u2019Tis hatch\u2019d, and shall be so: Tranio, at once\nUncase thee; take my colour\u2019d hat and cloak.\nWhen Biondello comes, he waits on thee;\nBut I will charm him first to keep his tongue.\n\n[_They exchange habits_]\n\nTRANIO.\nSo had you need.\nIn brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,\nAnd I am tied to be obedient;\nFor so your father charg\u2019d me at our parting,\n\u2018Be serviceable to my son,\u2019 quoth he,\nAlthough I think \u2019twas in another sense:\nI am content to be Lucentio,\nBecause so well I love Lucentio.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTranio, be so, because Lucentio loves;\nAnd let me be a slave, to achieve that maid\nWhose sudden sight hath thrall\u2019d my wounded eye.\n\n\nEnter Biondello.\n\nHere comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nWhere have I been? Nay, how now! where are you?\nMaster, has my fellow Tranio stol\u2019n your clothes?\nOr you stol\u2019n his? or both? Pray, what\u2019s the news?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nSirrah, come hither: \u2019tis no time to jest,\nAnd therefore frame your manners to the time.\nYour fellow Tranio here, to save my life,\nPuts my apparel and my count\u2019nance on,\nAnd I for my escape have put on his;\nFor in a quarrel since I came ashore\nI kill\u2019d a man, and fear I was descried.\nWait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,\nWhile I make way from hence to save my life.\nYou understand me?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nI, sir! Ne\u2019er a whit.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nAnd not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:\nTranio is changed to Lucentio.\n\nBIONDELLO.\nThe better for him: would I were so too!\n\nTRANIO.\nSo could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,\nThat Lucentio indeed had Baptista\u2019s youngest daughter.\nBut, sirrah, not for my sake but your master\u2019s, I advise\nYou use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:\nWhen I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;\nBut in all places else your master, Lucentio.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTranio, let\u2019s go.\nOne thing more rests, that thyself execute,\nTo make one among these wooers: if thou ask me why,\nSufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.\n\n[_Exeunt._]\n\n[_The Presenters above speak._]\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nMy lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.\n\nSLY.\nYes, by Saint Anne, I do.

Whom should I knock? Is there any man has rebused your\nworship?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nVillain, I say, knock me here soundly.\n\nGRUMIO.\nKnock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you\nhere, sir?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nVillain, I say, knock me at this gate;\nAnd rap me well, or I\u2019ll knock your knave\u2019s pate.\n\nGRUMIO.\nMy master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,\nAnd then I know after who comes by the worst.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWill it not be?\nFaith, sirrah, and you\u2019ll not knock, I\u2019ll ring it;\nI\u2019ll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.\n\n[_He wrings Grumio by the ears._]\n\nGRUMIO.\nHelp, masters, help! my master is mad.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNow, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!\n\n\nEnter Hortensio.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nHow now! what\u2019s the matter? My old friend Grumio! and my good friend\nPetruchio! How do you all at Verona?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSignior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?\n_Con tutto il cuore ben trovato_, may I say.\n\nHORTENSIO.\n_Alla nostra casa ben venuto; molto honorato signor mio Petruchio._\nRise, Grumio, rise: we will compound this quarrel.\n\nGRUMIO.\nNay, \u2019tis no matter, sir, what he \u2019leges in Latin. If this be not a\nlawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir, he bid me\nknock him and rap him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to\nuse his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a\npip out? Whom would to God I had well knock\u2019d at first, then had not\nGrumio come by the worst.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nA senseless villain! Good Hortensio,\nI bade the rascal knock upon your gate,\nAnd could not get him for my heart to do it.\n\nGRUMIO.\nKnock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these words plain: \u2018Sirrah\nknock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly\u2019? And\ncome you now with \u2018knocking at the gate\u2019?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nPetruchio, patience; I am Grumio\u2019s pledge;\nWhy, this\u2019s a heavy chance \u2019twixt him and you,\nYour ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.\nAnd tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale\nBlows you to Padua here from old Verona?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSuch wind as scatters young men through the world\nTo seek their fortunes farther than at home,\nWhere small experience grows. But in a few,\nSignior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:\nAntonio, my father, is deceas\u2019d,\nAnd I have thrust myself into this maze,\nHaply to wive and thrive as best I may;\nCrowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,\nAnd so am come abroad to see the world.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nPetruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee\nAnd wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour\u2019d wife?\nThou\u2019dst thank me but a little for my counsel;\nAnd yet I\u2019ll promise thee she shall be rich,\nAnd very rich: but th\u2019art too much my friend,\nAnd I\u2019ll not wish thee to her.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSignior Hortensio, \u2019twixt such friends as we\nFew words suffice; and therefore, if thou know\nOne rich enough to be Petruchio\u2019s wife,\nAs wealth is burden of my wooing dance,\nBe she as foul as was Florentius\u2019 love,\nAs old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd\nAs Socrates\u2019 Xanthippe or a worse,\nShe moves me not, or not removes, at least,\nAffection\u2019s edge in me, were she as rough\nAs are the swelling Adriatic seas:\nI come to wive it wealthily in Padua;\nIf wealthily, then happily in Padua.\n\nGRUMIO.\nNay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why, give him\ngold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot\nwith ne\u2019er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as\ntwo-and-fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nPetruchio, since we are stepp\u2019d thus far in,\nI will continue that I broach\u2019d in jest.\nI can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife\nWith wealth enough, and young and beauteous;\nBrought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:\nHer only fault,\u2014and that is faults enough,\u2014\nIs, that she is intolerable curst,\nAnd shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,\nThat, were my state far worser than it is,\nI would not wed her for a mine of gold.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nHortensio, peace! thou know\u2019st not gold\u2019s effect:\nTell me her father\u2019s name, and \u2019tis enough;\nFor I will board her, though she chide as loud\nAs thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nHer father is Baptista Minola,\nAn affable and courteous gentleman;\nHer name is Katherina Minola,\nRenown\u2019d in Padua for her scolding tongue.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nI know her father, though I know not her;\nAnd he knew my deceased father well.\nI will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;\nAnd therefore let me be thus bold with you,\nTo give you over at this first encounter,\nUnless you will accompany me thither.\n\nGRUMIO.\nI pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O\u2019 my word, and she\nknew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good\nupon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so; why,\nthat\u2019s nothing; and he begin once, he\u2019ll rail in his rope-tricks. I\u2019ll\ntell you what, sir, and she stand him but a little, he will throw a\nfigure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no\nmore eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nTarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,\nFor in Baptista\u2019s keep my treasure is:\nHe hath the jewel of my life in hold,\nHis youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,\nAnd her withholds from me and other more,\nSuitors to her and rivals in my love;\nSupposing it a thing impossible,\nFor those defects I have before rehears\u2019d,\nThat ever Katherina will be woo\u2019d:\nTherefore this order hath Baptista ta\u2019en,\nThat none shall have access unto Bianca\nTill Katherine the curst have got a husband.\n\nGRUMIO.\nKatherine the curst!\nA title for a maid of all titles the worst.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nNow shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,\nAnd offer me disguis\u2019d in sober robes,\nTo old Baptista as a schoolmaster\nWell seen in music, to instruct Bianca;\nThat so I may, by this device at least\nHave leave and leisure to make love to her,\nAnd unsuspected court her by herself.\n\nGRUMIO.\nHere\u2019s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks\nlay their heads together!\n\nEnter Gremio and Lucentio disguised, with books under his arm.\n\nMaster, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nPeace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio, stand by awhile.\n\nGRUMIO.\nA proper stripling, and an amorous!\n\nGREMIO.\nO! very well; I have perus\u2019d the note.\nHark you, sir; I\u2019ll have them very fairly bound:\nAll books of love, see that at any hand,\nAnd see you read no other lectures to her.\nYou understand me. Over and beside\nSignior Baptista\u2019s liberality,\nI\u2019ll mend it with a largess. Take your papers too,\nAnd let me have them very well perfum\u2019d;\nFor she is sweeter than perfume itself\nTo whom they go to. What will you read to her?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nWhate\u2019er I read to her, I\u2019ll plead for you,\nAs for my patron, stand you so assur\u2019d,\nAs firmly as yourself were still in place;\nYea, and perhaps with more successful words\nThan you, unless you were a scholar, sir.\n\nGREMIO.\nO! this learning, what a thing it is.\n\nGRUMIO.\nO! this woodcock, what an ass it is.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nPeace, sirrah!\n\nHORTENSIO.\nGrumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio!\n\nGREMIO.\nAnd you are well met, Signior Hortensio.\nTrow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.\nI promis\u2019d to enquire carefully\nAbout a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;\nAnd by good fortune I have lighted well\nOn this young man; for learning and behaviour\nFit for her turn, well read in poetry\nAnd other books, good ones, I warrant ye.\n\nHORTENSIO.\n\u2019Tis well; and I have met a gentleman\nHath promis\u2019d me to help me to another,\nA fine musician to instruct our mistress:\nSo shall I no whit be behind in duty\nTo fair Bianca, so belov\u2019d of me.\n\nGREMIO.\nBelov\u2019d of me, and that my deeds shall prove.\n\nGRUMIO.\n[_Aside._] And that his bags shall prove.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nGremio, \u2019tis now no time to vent our love:\nListen to me, and if you speak me fair,\nI\u2019ll tell you news indifferent good for either.\nHere is a gentleman whom by chance I met,\nUpon agreement from us to his liking,\nWill undertake to woo curst Katherine;\nYea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.\n\nGREMIO.\nSo said, so done, is well.\nHortensio, have you told him all her faults?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nI know she is an irksome brawling scold;\nIf that be all, masters, I hear no harm.\n\nGREMIO.\nNo, say\u2019st me so, friend? What countryman?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nBorn in Verona, old Antonio\u2019s son.\nMy father dead, my fortune lives for me;\nAnd I do hope good days and long to see.\n\nGREMIO.\nO sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!\nBut if you have a stomach, to\u2019t a God\u2019s name;\nYou shall have me assisting you in all.\nBut will you woo this wild-cat?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWill I live?\n\nGRUMIO.\nWill he woo her? Ay, or I\u2019ll hang her.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhy came I hither but to that intent?\nThink you a little din can daunt mine ears?\nHave I not in my time heard lions roar?\nHave I not heard the sea, puff\u2019d up with winds,\nRage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?\nHave I not heard great ordnance in the field,\nAnd heaven\u2019s artillery thunder in the skies?\nHave I not in a pitched battle heard\nLoud \u2019larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets\u2019 clang?\nAnd do you tell me of a woman\u2019s tongue,\nThat gives not half so great a blow to hear\nAs will a chestnut in a farmer\u2019s fire?\nTush, tush! fear boys with bugs.\n\nGRUMIO.\n[_Aside_] For he fears none.\n\nGREMIO.\nHortensio, hark:\nThis gentleman is happily arriv\u2019d,\nMy mind presumes, for his own good and yours.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nI promis\u2019d we would be contributors,\nAnd bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe\u2019er.\n\nGREMIO.\nAnd so we will, provided that he win her.\n\nGRUMIO.\nI would I were as sure of a good dinner.\n\n\nEnter Tranio brave, and Biondello.\n\nTRANIO.\nGentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,\nTell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way\nTo the house of Signior Baptista Minola?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nHe that has the two fair daughters; is\u2019t he you mean?\n\nTRANIO.\nEven he, Biondello!\n\nGREMIO.\nHark you, sir, you mean not her to\u2014\n\nTRANIO.\nPerhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNot her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.\n\nTRANIO.\nI love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let\u2019s away.\n\nLUCENTIO.\n[_Aside_]  Well begun, Tranio.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSir, a word ere you go.\nAre you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?\n\nTRANIO.\nAnd if I be, sir, is it any offence?\n\nGREMIO.\nNo; if without more words you will get you hence.\n\nTRANIO.\nWhy, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free\nFor me as for you?\n\nGREMIO.\nBut so is not she.\n\nTRANIO.\nFor what reason, I beseech you?\n\nGREMIO.\nFor this reason, if you\u2019ll know,\nThat she\u2019s the choice love of Signior Gremio.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nThat she\u2019s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.\n\nTRANIO.\nSoftly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,\nDo me this right; hear me with patience.\nBaptista is a noble gentleman,\nTo whom my father is not all unknown;\nAnd were his daughter fairer than she is,\nShe may more suitors have, and me for one.\nFair Leda\u2019s daughter had a thousand wooers;\nThen well one more may fair Bianca have;\nAnd so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,\nThough Paris came in hope to speed alone.\n\nGREMIO.\nWhat, this gentleman will out-talk us all.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nSir, give him head; I know he\u2019ll prove a jade.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nHortensio, to what end are all these words?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSir, let me be so bold as ask you,\nDid you yet ever see Baptista\u2019s daughter?\n\nTRANIO.\nNo, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,\nThe one as famous for a scolding tongue\nAs is the other for beauteous modesty.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSir, sir, the first\u2019s for me; let her go by.\n\nGREMIO.\nYea, leave that labour to great Hercules,\nAnd let it be more than Alcides\u2019 twelve.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSir, understand you this of me, in sooth:\nThe youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,\nHer father keeps from all access of suitors,\nAnd will not promise her to any man\nUntil the elder sister first be wed;\nThe younger then is free, and not before.\n\nTRANIO.\nIf it be so, sir, that you are the man\nMust stead us all, and me amongst the rest;\nAnd if you break the ice, and do this feat,\nAchieve the elder, set the younger free\nFor our access, whose hap shall be to have her\nWill not so graceless be to be ingrate.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSir, you say well, and well you do conceive;\nAnd since you do profess to be a suitor,\nYou must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,\nTo whom we all rest generally beholding.\n\nTRANIO.\nSir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,\nPlease ye we may contrive this afternoon,\nAnd quaff carouses to our mistress\u2019 health;\nAnd do as adversaries do in law,\nStrive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.\n\nGRUMIO, BIONDELLO.\nO excellent motion!

Come on, and kiss me, Kate.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nWell, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha\u2019t.\n\nVINCENTIO.\n\u2019Tis a good hearing when children are toward.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nBut a harsh hearing when women are froward.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nCome, Kate, we\u2019ll to bed.\nWe three are married, but you two are sped.\n\u2019Twas I won the wager,\n[_To Lucentio._] though you hit the white;\nAnd being a winner, God give you good night!\n\n[_Exeunt Petrucio and Katherina._]\n\nHORTENSIO.\nNow go thy ways; thou hast tam\u2019d a curst shrew.\n\nLUCENTIO.\n\u2019Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam\u2019d so.\n\n[_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\n\n"
