An Apartment in the Duke\u2019s Palace.\n\n Enter Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other Lords; Musicians\n attending.\n\nDUKE.\nIf music be the food of love, play on,\nGive me excess of it; that, surfeiting,\nThe appetite may sicken and so die.\nThat strain again, it had a dying fall;\nO, it came o\u2019er my ear like the sweet sound\nThat breathes upon a bank of violets,\nStealing and giving odour. Enough; no more;\n\u2019Tis not so sweet now as it was before.\nO spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,\nThat notwithstanding thy capacity\nReceiveth as the sea, nought enters there,\nOf what validity and pitch soever,\nBut falls into abatement and low price\nEven in a minute! So full of shapes is fancy,\nThat it alone is high fantastical.\n\nCURIO.\nWill you go hunt, my lord?\n\nDUKE.\nWhat, Curio?\n\nCURIO.\nThe hart.\n\nDUKE.\nWhy so I do, the noblest that I have.\nO, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,\nMethought she purg\u2019d the air of pestilence;\nThat instant was I turn\u2019d into a hart,\nAnd my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,\nE\u2019er since pursue me. How now? what news from her?\n\n Enter Valentine.\n\nVALENTINE.\nSo please my lord, I might not be admitted,\nBut from her handmaid do return this answer:\nThe element itself, till seven years\u2019 heat,\nShall not behold her face at ample view;\nBut like a cloistress she will veiled walk,\nAnd water once a day her chamber round\nWith eye-offending brine: all this to season\nA brother\u2019s dead love, which she would keep fresh\nAnd lasting in her sad remembrance.\n\nDUKE.\nO, she that hath a heart of that fine frame\nTo pay this debt of love but to a brother,\nHow will she love, when the rich golden shaft\nHath kill\u2019d the flock of all affections else\nThat live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,\nThese sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill\u2019d\nHer sweet perfections with one self king!\nAway before me to sweet beds of flowers,\nLove-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. The sea-coast.\n\n Enter Viola, a Captain and Sailors.\n\nVIOLA.\nWhat country, friends, is this?\n\nCAPTAIN.\nThis is Illyria, lady.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd what should I do in Illyria?\nMy brother he is in Elysium.\nPerchance he is not drown\u2019d. What think you, sailors?\n\nCAPTAIN.\nIt is perchance that you yourself were sav\u2019d.\n\nVIOLA.\nO my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.\n\nCAPTAIN.\nTrue, madam; and to comfort you with chance,\nAssure yourself, after our ship did split,\nWhen you, and those poor number sav\u2019d with you,\nHung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,\nMost provident in peril, bind himself,\n(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)\nTo a strong mast that liv\u2019d upon the sea;\nWhere, like Arion on the dolphin\u2019s back,\nI saw him hold acquaintance with the waves\nSo long as I could see.\n\nVIOLA.\nFor saying so, there\u2019s gold!\nMine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,\nWhereto thy speech serves for authority,\nThe like of him. Know\u2019st thou this country?\n\nCAPTAIN.\nAy, madam, well, for I was bred and born\nNot three hours\u2019 travel from this very place.\n\nVIOLA.\nWho governs here?\n\nCAPTAIN.\nA noble duke, in nature as in name.\n\nVIOLA.\nWhat is his name?\n\nCAPTAIN.\nOrsino.\n\nVIOLA.\nOrsino! I have heard my father name him.\nHe was a bachelor then.\n\nCAPTAIN.\nAnd so is now, or was so very late;\nFor but a month ago I went from hence,\nAnd then \u2019twas fresh in murmur, (as, you know,\nWhat great ones do, the less will prattle of)\nThat he did seek the love of fair Olivia.\n\nVIOLA.\nWhat\u2019s she?\n\nCAPTAIN.\nA virtuous maid, the daughter of a count\nThat died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her\nIn the protection of his son, her brother,\nWho shortly also died; for whose dear love\nThey say, she hath abjur\u2019d the company\nAnd sight of men.\n\nVIOLA.\nO that I served that lady,\nAnd might not be delivered to the world,\nTill I had made mine own occasion mellow,\nWhat my estate is.\n\nCAPTAIN.\nThat were hard to compass,\nBecause she will admit no kind of suit,\nNo, not the Duke\u2019s.\n\nVIOLA.\nThere is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain;\nAnd though that nature with a beauteous wall\nDoth oft close in pollution, yet of thee\nI will believe thou hast a mind that suits\nWith this thy fair and outward character.\nI pray thee, and I\u2019ll pay thee bounteously,\nConceal me what I am, and be my aid\nFor such disguise as haply shall become\nThe form of my intent. I\u2019ll serve this duke;\nThou shalt present me as an eunuch to him.\nIt may be worth thy pains; for I can sing,\nAnd speak to him in many sorts of music,\nThat will allow me very worth his service.\nWhat else may hap, to time I will commit;\nOnly shape thou thy silence to my wit.\n\nCAPTAIN.\nBe you his eunuch and your mute I\u2019ll be;\nWhen my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.\n\nVIOLA.\nI thank thee. Lead me on.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. A Room in Olivia\u2019s House.\n\n Enter Sir Toby and Maria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I\nam sure care\u2019s an enemy to life.\n\nMARIA.\nBy my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o\u2019 nights; your cousin,\nmy lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, let her except, before excepted.\n\nMARIA.\nAy, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nConfine? I\u2019ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good\nenough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let\nthem hang themselves in their own straps.\n\nMARIA.\nThat quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it\nyesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here\nto be her wooer.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWho? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?\n\nMARIA.\nAy, he.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHe\u2019s as tall a man as any\u2019s in Illyria.\n\nMARIA.\nWhat\u2019s that to th\u2019 purpose?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, he has three thousand ducats a year.\n\nMARIA.\nAy, but he\u2019ll have but a year in all these ducats. He\u2019s a very fool,\nand a prodigal.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nFie, that you\u2019ll say so! he plays o\u2019 the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks\nthree or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the\ngood gifts of nature.\n\nMARIA.\nHe hath indeed, almost natural: for, besides that he\u2019s a fool, he\u2019s a\ngreat quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay\nthe gust he hath in quarrelling, \u2019tis thought among the prudent he\nwould quickly have the gift of a grave.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nBy this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him.\nWho are they?\n\nMARIA.\nThey that add, moreover, he\u2019s drunk nightly in your company.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWith drinking healths to my niece; I\u2019ll drink to her as long as there\nis a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He\u2019s a coward and a\ncoystril that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o\u2019 the\ntoe like a parish top. What, wench! _Castiliano vulgo:_ for here comes\nSir Andrew Agueface.\n\n Enter Sir Andrew.\n\nAGUECHEEK.\nSir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nSweet Sir Andrew!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nBless you, fair shrew.\n\nMARIA.\nAnd you too, sir.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAccost, Sir Andrew, accost.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWhat\u2019s that?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nMy niece\u2019s chamber-maid.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nGood Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.\n\nMARIA.\nMy name is Mary, sir.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nGood Mistress Mary Accost,\u2014\n\nSIR TOBY.\nYou mistake, knight: accost is front her, board her, woo her, assail\nher.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nBy my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the\nmeaning of accost?\n\nMARIA.\nFare you well, gentlemen.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword\nagain.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair\nlady, do you think you have fools in hand?\n\nMARIA.\nSir, I have not you by the hand.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nMarry, but you shall have, and here\u2019s my hand.\n\nMARIA.\nNow, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th\u2019 buttery\nbar and let it drink.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWherefore, sweetheart? What\u2019s your metaphor?\n\nMARIA.\nIt\u2019s dry, sir.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWhy, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But\nwhat\u2019s your jest?\n\nMARIA.\nA dry jest, sir.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAre you full of them?\n\nMARIA.\nAy, sir, I have them at my fingers\u2019 ends: marry, now I let go your\nhand, I am barren.\n\n [_Exit Maria._]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nO knight, thou lack\u2019st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put\ndown?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nNever in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down.\nMethinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary\nman has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm\nto my wit.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nNo question.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd I thought that, I\u2019d forswear it. I\u2019ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n_Pourquoy_, my dear knight?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWhat is _pourquoy?_ Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in\nthe tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I\nbut followed the arts!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThen hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWhy, would that have mended my hair?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPast question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nBut it becomes me well enough, does\u2019t not?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nExcellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a\nhouswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nFaith, I\u2019ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby; your niece will not be seen, or if\nshe be, it\u2019s four to one she\u2019ll none of me; the Count himself here hard\nby woos her.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nShe\u2019ll none o\u2019 the Count; she\u2019ll not match above her degree, neither in\nestate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear\u2019t. Tut, there\u2019s life\nin\u2019t, man.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI\u2019ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o\u2019 the strangest mind i\u2019 the\nworld; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nArt thou good at these kick-shawses, knight?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAs any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my\nbetters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nFaith, I can cut a caper.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd I can cut the mutton to\u2019t.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in\nIllyria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain\nbefore \u2019em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall\u2019s picture?\nWhy dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a\ncoranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make\nwater but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide\nvirtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it\nwas formed under the star of a galliard.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAy, \u2019tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dam\u2019d-colour\u2019d\nstock. Shall we set about some revels?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nTaurus? That\u2019s sides and heart.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nNo, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher: ha,\nha, excellent!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Room in the Duke\u2019s Palace.\n\n Enter Valentine and Viola in man\u2019s attire.\n\nVALENTINE.\nIf the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like\nto be much advanced; he hath known you but three days, and already you\nare no stranger.\n\nVIOLA.\nYou either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question\nthe continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?\n\nVALENTINE.\nNo, believe me.\n\n Enter Duke, Curio and Attendants.\n\nVIOLA.\nI thank you. Here comes the Count.\n\nDUKE.\nWho saw Cesario, ho?\n\nVIOLA.\nOn your attendance, my lord, here.\n\nDUKE.\nStand you awhile aloof.\u2014Cesario,\nThou know\u2019st no less but all; I have unclasp\u2019d\nTo thee the book even of my secret soul.\nTherefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her,\nBe not denied access, stand at her doors,\nAnd tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow\nTill thou have audience.\n\nVIOLA.\nSure, my noble lord,\nIf she be so abandon\u2019d to her sorrow\nAs it is spoke, she never will admit me.\n\nDUKE.\nBe clamorous and leap all civil bounds,\nRather than make unprofited return.\n\nVIOLA.\nSay I do speak with her, my lord, what then?\n\nDUKE.\nO then unfold the passion of my love,\nSurprise her with discourse of my dear faith;\nIt shall become thee well to act my woes;\nShe will attend it better in thy youth,\nThan in a nuncio\u2019s of more grave aspect.\n\nVIOLA.\nI think not so, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nDear lad, believe it;\nFor they shall yet belie thy happy years,\nThat say thou art a man: Diana\u2019s lip\nIs not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe\nIs as the maiden\u2019s organ, shrill and sound,\nAnd all is semblative a woman\u2019s part.\nI know thy constellation is right apt\nFor this affair. Some four or five attend him:\nAll, if you will; for I myself am best\nWhen least in company. Prosper well in this,\nAnd thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,\nTo call his fortunes thine.\n\nVIOLA.\nI\u2019ll do my best\nTo woo your lady. [_Aside._] Yet, a barful strife!\nWhoe\u2019er I woo, myself would be his wife.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. A Room in Olivia\u2019s House.\n\n Enter Maria and Clown.\n\nMARIA.\nNay; either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so\nwide as a bristle may enter, in way of thy excuse: my lady will hang\nthee for thy absence.\n\nCLOWN.\nLet her hang me: he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no\ncolours.\n\nMARIA.\nMake that good.\n\nCLOWN.\nHe shall see none to fear.\n\nMARIA.\nA good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was born, of I\nfear no colours.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhere, good Mistress Mary?\n\nMARIA.\nIn the wars, and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.\n\nCLOWN.\nWell, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let\nthem use their talents.\n\nMARIA.\nYet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or to be turned away;\nis not that as good as a hanging to you?\n\nCLOWN.\nMany a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and for turning away, let\nsummer bear it out.\n\nMARIA.\nYou are resolute then?\n\nCLOWN.\nNot so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.\n\nMARIA.\nThat if one break, the other will hold; or if both break, your gaskins\nfall.\n\nCLOWN.\nApt, in good faith, very apt! Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby would leave\ndrinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve\u2019s flesh as any in Illyria.\n\nMARIA.\nPeace, you rogue, no more o\u2019 that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse\nwisely, you were best.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n Enter Olivia with Malvolio.\n\nCLOWN.\nWit, and\u2019t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think\nthey have thee, do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack\nthee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? Better a witty\nfool than a foolish wit. God bless thee, lady!\n\nOLIVIA.\nTake the fool away.\n\nCLOWN.\nDo you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGo to, y\u2019are a dry fool; I\u2019ll no more of you. Besides, you grow\ndishonest.\n\nCLOWN.\nTwo faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend: for give\nthe dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man\nmend himself, if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let\nthe botcher mend him. Anything that\u2019s mended is but patched; virtue\nthat transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but\npatched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if\nit will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so\nbeauty\u2019s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool, therefore, I say\nagain, take her away.\n\nOLIVIA.\nSir, I bade them take away you.\n\nCLOWN.\nMisprision in the highest degree! Lady, _cucullus non facit monachum:_\nthat\u2019s as much to say, I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna,\ngive me leave to prove you a fool.\n\nOLIVIA.\nCan you do it?\n\nCLOWN.\nDexteriously, good madonna.\n\nOLIVIA.\nMake your proof.\n\nCLOWN.\nI must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer\nme.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWell sir, for want of other idleness, I\u2019ll \u2019bide your proof.\n\nCLOWN.\nGood madonna, why mourn\u2019st thou?\n\nOLIVIA.\nGood fool, for my brother\u2019s death.\n\nCLOWN.\nI think his soul is in hell, madonna.\n\nOLIVIA.\nI know his soul is in heaven, fool.\n\nCLOWN.\nThe more fool you, madonna, to mourn for your brother\u2019s soul being in\nheaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nYes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that\ndecays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.\n\nCLOWN.\nGod send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your\nfolly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass\nhis word for twopence that you are no fool.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHow say you to that, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; I saw him\nput down the other day with an ordinary fool, that has no more brain\nthan a stone. Look you now, he\u2019s out of his guard already; unless you\nlaugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest I take\nthese wise men, that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than\nthe fools\u2019 zanies.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered\nappetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to\ntake those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is\nno slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no\nrailing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.\n\nCLOWN.\nNow Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak\u2019st well of fools!\n\n Enter Maria.\n\nMARIA.\nMadam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak\nwith you.\n\nOLIVIA.\nFrom the Count Orsino, is it?\n\nMARIA.\nI know not, madam; \u2019tis a fair young man, and well attended.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWho of my people hold him in delay?\n\nMARIA.\nSir Toby, madam, your kinsman.\n\nOLIVIA.\nFetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman. Fie on him!\n\n [_Exit Maria._]\n\nGo you, Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick, or not at\nhome. What you will, to dismiss it.\n\n [_Exit Malvolio._]\n\nNow you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.\n\nCLOWN.\nThou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool:\nwhose skull Jove cram with brains, for here he comes, one of thy kin\nhas a most weak _pia mater_.\n\n Enter Sir Toby.\n\nOLIVIA.\nBy mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nA gentleman.\n\nOLIVIA.\nA gentleman? What gentleman?\n\nSIR TOBY.\n\u2019Tis a gentleman here. A plague o\u2019 these pickle-herrings! How now, sot?\n\nCLOWN.\nGood Sir Toby.\n\nOLIVIA.\nCousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nLechery! I defy lechery. There\u2019s one at the gate.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAy, marry, what is he?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nLet him be the devil an he will, I care not: give me faith, say I.\nWell, it\u2019s all one.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat\u2019s a drunken man like, fool?\n\nCLOWN.\nLike a drowned man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat makes\nhim a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGo thou and seek the coroner, and let him sit o\u2019 my coz; for he\u2019s in\nthe third degree of drink; he\u2019s drowned. Go, look after him.\n\nCLOWN.\nHe is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the madman.\n\n [_Exit Clown._]\n\n Enter Malvolio.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMadam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you\nwere sick; he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes\nto speak with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to have a\nforeknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What\nis to be said to him, lady? He\u2019s fortified against any denial.\n\nOLIVIA.\nTell him, he shall not speak with me.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nHas been told so; and he says he\u2019ll stand at your door like a sheriff\u2019s\npost, and be the supporter of a bench, but he\u2019ll speak with you.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat kind o\u2019 man is he?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nWhy, of mankind.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat manner of man?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nOf very ill manner; he\u2019ll speak with you, will you or no.\n\nOLIVIA.\nOf what personage and years is he?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nNot yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash\nis before \u2019tis a peascod, or a codling, when \u2019tis almost an apple. \u2019Tis\nwith him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very\nwell-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his\nmother\u2019s milk were scarce out of him.\n\nOLIVIA.\nLet him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nGentlewoman, my lady calls.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n Enter Maria.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGive me my veil; come, throw it o\u2019er my face.\nWe\u2019ll once more hear Orsino\u2019s embassy.\n\n Enter Viola.\n\nVIOLA.\nThe honourable lady of the house, which is she?\n\nOLIVIA.\nSpeak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?\n\nVIOLA.\nMost radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,\u2014I pray you, tell me if\nthis be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to\ncast away my speech; for besides that it is excellently well penned, I\nhave taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no\nscorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhence came you, sir?\n\nVIOLA.\nI can say little more than I have studied, and that question\u2019s out of\nmy part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance, if you be the lady\nof the house, that I may proceed in my speech.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAre you a comedian?\n\nVIOLA.\nNo, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I\nam not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?\n\nOLIVIA.\nIf I do not usurp myself, I am.\n\nVIOLA.\nMost certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours\nto bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I\nwill on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of\nmy message.\n\nOLIVIA.\nCome to what is important in\u2019t: I forgive you the praise.\n\nVIOLA.\nAlas, I took great pains to study it, and \u2019tis poetical.\n\nOLIVIA.\nIt is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you\nwere saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at\nyou than to hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be\nbrief: \u2019tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a\ndialogue.\n\nMARIA.\nWill you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.\n\nVIOLA.\nNo, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification\nfor your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger.\n\nOLIVIA.\nSure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it\nis so fearful. Speak your office.\n\nVIOLA.\nIt alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of\nhomage; I hold the olive in my hand: my words are as full of peace as\nmatter.\n\nOLIVIA.\nYet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?\n\nVIOLA.\nThe rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my\nentertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead:\nto your ears, divinity; to any other\u2019s, profanation.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGive us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.\n\n [_Exit Maria._]\n\nNow, sir, what is your text?\n\nVIOLA.\nMost sweet lady\u2014\n\nOLIVIA.\nA comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your\ntext?\n\nVIOLA.\nIn Orsino\u2019s bosom.\n\nOLIVIA.\nIn his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?\n\nVIOLA.\nTo answer by the method, in the first of his heart.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?\n\nVIOLA.\nGood madam, let me see your face.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHave you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You\nare now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain and show you the\npicture. [_Unveiling._] Look you, sir, such a one I was this present.\nIs\u2019t not well done?\n\nVIOLA.\nExcellently done, if God did all.\n\nOLIVIA.\n\u2019Tis in grain, sir; \u2019twill endure wind and weather.\n\nVIOLA.\n\u2019Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white\nNature\u2019s own sweet and cunning hand laid on.\nLady, you are the cruel\u2019st she alive\nIf you will lead these graces to the grave,\nAnd leave the world no copy.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules\nof my beauty. It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil\nlabelled to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item, two grey\neyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were\nyou sent hither to praise me?\n\nVIOLA.\nI see you what you are, you are too proud;\nBut, if you were the devil, you are fair.\nMy lord and master loves you. O, such love\nCould be but recompens\u2019d though you were crown\u2019d\nThe nonpareil of beauty!\n\nOLIVIA.\nHow does he love me?\n\nVIOLA.\nWith adorations, fertile tears,\nWith groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.\n\nOLIVIA.\nYour lord does know my mind, I cannot love him:\nYet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,\nOf great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;\nIn voices well divulg\u2019d, free, learn\u2019d, and valiant,\nAnd in dimension and the shape of nature,\nA gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.\nHe might have took his answer long ago.\n\nVIOLA.\nIf I did love you in my master\u2019s flame,\nWith such a suff\u2019ring, such a deadly life,\nIn your denial I would find no sense,\nI would not understand it.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhy, what would you?\n\nVIOLA.\nMake me a willow cabin at your gate,\nAnd call upon my soul within the house;\nWrite loyal cantons of contemned love,\nAnd sing them loud even in the dead of night;\nHallow your name to the reverberate hills,\nAnd make the babbling gossip of the air\nCry out Olivia! O, you should not rest\nBetween the elements of air and earth,\nBut you should pity me.\n\nOLIVIA.\nYou might do much.\nWhat is your parentage?\n\nVIOLA.\nAbove my fortunes, yet my state is well:\nI am a gentleman.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGet you to your lord;\nI cannot love him: let him send no more,\nUnless, perchance, you come to me again,\nTo tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:\nI thank you for your pains: spend this for me.\n\nVIOLA.\nI am no fee\u2019d post, lady; keep your purse;\nMy master, not myself, lacks recompense.\nLove make his heart of flint that you shall love,\nAnd let your fervour like my master\u2019s be\nPlac\u2019d in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat is your parentage?\n\u2018Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:\nI am a gentleman.\u2019 I\u2019ll be sworn thou art;\nThy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit,\nDo give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast: soft, soft!\nUnless the master were the man. How now?\nEven so quickly may one catch the plague?\nMethinks I feel this youth\u2019s perfections\nWith an invisible and subtle stealth\nTo creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.\nWhat ho, Malvolio!\n\n Enter Malvolio.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nHere, madam, at your service.\n\nOLIVIA.\nRun after that same peevish messenger\nThe County\u2019s man: he left this ring behind him,\nWould I or not; tell him, I\u2019ll none of it.\nDesire him not to flatter with his lord,\nNor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him.\nIf that the youth will come this way tomorrow,\nI\u2019ll give him reasons for\u2019t. Hie thee, Malvolio.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMadam, I will.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nOLIVIA.\nI do I know not what, and fear to find\nMine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.\nFate, show thy force, ourselves we do not owe.\nWhat is decreed must be; and be this so!\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\nACT II.\n\nSCENE I. The sea-coast.\n\n Enter Antonio and Sebastian.\n\nANTONIO.\nWill you stay no longer? Nor will you not that I go with you?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nBy your patience, no; my stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of\nmy fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you\nyour leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for\nyour love, to lay any of them on you.\n\nANTONIO.\nLet me know of you whither you are bound.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nNo, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I\nperceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not\nextort from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in\nmanners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then,\nAntonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo; my father was\nthat Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left\nbehind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens\nhad been pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that,\nfor some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my\nsister drowned.\n\nANTONIO.\nAlas the day!\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nA lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many\naccounted beautiful. But though I could not with such estimable wonder\noverfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her, she bore\na mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir,\nwith salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with\nmore.\n\nANTONIO.\nPardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nO good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.\n\nANTONIO.\nIf you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nIf you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you\nhave recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once; my bosom is full\nof kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon\nthe least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to\nthe Count Orsino\u2019s court: farewell.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nANTONIO.\nThe gentleness of all the gods go with thee!\nI have many enemies in Orsino\u2019s court,\nElse would I very shortly see thee there:\nBut come what may, I do adore thee so,\nThat danger shall seem sport, and I will go.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II. A street.\n\n Enter Viola; Malvolio at several doors.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nWere you not even now with the Countess Olivia?\n\nVIOLA.\nEven now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nShe returns this ring to you, sir; you might have saved me my pains, to\nhave taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put\nyour lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him. And one\nthing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs,\nunless it be to report your lord\u2019s taking of this. Receive it so.\n\nVIOLA.\nShe took the ring of me: I\u2019ll none of it.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nCome sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is it should be\nso returned. If it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if\nnot, be it his that finds it.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nVIOLA.\nI left no ring with her; what means this lady?\nFortune forbid my outside have not charm\u2019d her!\nShe made good view of me, indeed, so much,\nThat methought her eyes had lost her tongue,\nFor she did speak in starts distractedly.\nShe loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion\nInvites me in this churlish messenger.\nNone of my lord\u2019s ring? Why, he sent her none.\nI am the man; if it be so, as \u2019tis,\nPoor lady, she were better love a dream.\nDisguise, I see thou art a wickedness\nWherein the pregnant enemy does much.\nHow easy is it for the proper false\nIn women\u2019s waxen hearts to set their forms!\nAlas, our frailty is the cause, not we,\nFor such as we are made of, such we be.\nHow will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,\nAnd I, poor monster, fond as much on him,\nAnd she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.\nWhat will become of this? As I am man,\nMy state is desperate for my master\u2019s love;\nAs I am woman (now alas the day!)\nWhat thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!\nO time, thou must untangle this, not I,\nIt is too hard a knot for me t\u2019untie!\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE III. A Room in Olivia\u2019s House.\n\n Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nApproach, Sir Andrew; not to be abed after midnight, is to be up\nbetimes; and _diluculo surgere_, thou know\u2019st.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nNay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late is to be up\nlate.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nA false conclusion; I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after\nmidnight, and to go to bed then is early: so that to go to bed after\nmidnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives consist of the\nfour elements?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nFaith, so they say, but I think it rather consists of eating and\ndrinking.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTh\u2019art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.\nMarian, I say! a stoup of wine.\n\n Enter Clown.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nHere comes the fool, i\u2019 faith.\n\nCLOWN.\nHow now, my hearts? Did you never see the picture of \u201cwe three\u201d?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWelcome, ass. Now let\u2019s have a catch.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nBy my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty\nshillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool\nhas. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou\nspok\u2019st of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of\nQueubus; \u2019twas very good, i\u2019 faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman.\nHadst it?\n\nCLOWN.\nI did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio\u2019s nose is no whipstock. My\nlady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nExcellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a\nsong.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome on, there is sixpence for you. Let\u2019s have a song.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nThere\u2019s a testril of me too: if one knight give a\u2014\n\nCLOWN.\nWould you have a love-song, or a song of good life?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nA love-song, a love-song.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAy, ay. I care not for good life.\n\nCLOWN. [_sings._]\n  _O mistress mine, where are you roaming?\n  O stay and hear, your true love\u2019s coming,\n    That can sing both high and low.\n  Trip no further, pretty sweeting.\n  Journeys end in lovers meeting,\n    Every wise man\u2019s son doth know._\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nExcellent good, i\u2019 faith.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGood, good.\n\nCLOWN.\n  _What is love? \u2019Tis not hereafter,\n  Present mirth hath present laughter.\n    What\u2019s to come is still unsure.\n  In delay there lies no plenty,\n  Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty.\n    Youth\u2019s a stuff will not endure._\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nA mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nA contagious breath.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nVery sweet and contagious, i\u2019 faith.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTo hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the\nwelkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will\ndraw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd you love me, let\u2019s do\u2019t: I am dog at a catch.\n\nCLOWN.\nBy\u2019r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nMost certain. Let our catch be, \u201cThou knave.\u201d\n\nCLOWN.\n\u201cHold thy peace, thou knave\u201d knight? I shall be constrain\u2019d in\u2019t to\ncall thee knave, knight.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n\u2019Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me knave. Begin,\nfool; it begins \u201cHold thy peace.\u201d\n\nCLOWN.\nI shall never begin if I hold my peace.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nGood, i\u2019 faith! Come, begin.\n\n [_Catch sung._]\n\n Enter Maria.\n\nMARIA.\nWhat a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not called up her\nsteward Malvolio, and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nMy lady\u2019s a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio\u2019s a Peg-a-Ramsey, and\n[_Sings._] _Three merry men be we._ Am not I consanguineous? Am I not\nof her blood? Tilly-vally! \u201cLady\u201d! _There dwelt a man in Babylon, Lady,\nLady._\n\nCLOWN.\nBeshrew me, the knight\u2019s in admirable fooling.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAy, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I too; he does it\nwith a better grace, but I do it more natural.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[_Sings._] _O\u2019 the twelfth day of December\u2014_\n\nMARIA.\nFor the love o\u2019 God, peace!\n\n Enter Malvolio.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMy masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no wit, manners, nor\nhonesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make\nan ale-house of my lady\u2019s house, that ye squeak out your coziers\u2019\ncatches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect\nof place, persons, nor time, in you?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWe did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you that,\nthough she harbours you as her kinsman she\u2019s nothing allied to your\ndisorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours, you are\nwelcome to the house; if not, and it would please you to take leave of\nher, she is very willing to bid you farewell.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[_Sings._] _Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone._\n\nMARIA.\nNay, good Sir Toby.\n\nCLOWN.\n[_Sings._] _His eyes do show his days are almost done._\n\nMALVOLIO.\nIs\u2019t even so?\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[_Sings._] _But I will never die._\n\nCLOWN.\n[_Sings._] _Sir Toby, there you lie._\n\nMALVOLIO.\nThis is much credit to you.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[_Sings._] _Shall I bid him go?_\n\nCLOWN.\n[_Sings._] _What and if you do?_\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[_Sings._] _Shall I bid him go, and spare not?_\n\nCLOWN.\n[_Sings._] _O, no, no, no, no, you dare not._\n\nSIR TOBY.\nOut o\u2019 tune? sir, ye lie. Art any more than a steward? Dost thou think,\nbecause thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?\n\nCLOWN.\nYes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i\u2019 the mouth too.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTh\u2019art i\u2019 the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs. A stoup of\nwine, Maria!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMistress Mary, if you prized my lady\u2019s favour at anything more than\ncontempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule; she shall\nknow of it, by this hand.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nMARIA.\nGo shake your ears.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n\u2019Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man\u2019s a-hungry, to challenge\nhim the field, and then to break promise with him and make a fool of\nhim.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nDo\u2019t, knight. I\u2019ll write thee a challenge; or I\u2019ll deliver thy\nindignation to him by word of mouth.\n\nMARIA.\nSweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the youth of the Count\u2019s\nwas today with my lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur\nMalvolio, let me alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword,\nand make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie\nstraight in my bed. I know I can do it.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPossess us, possess us, tell us something of him.\n\nMARIA.\nMarry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of Puritan.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nO, if I thought that, I\u2019d beat him like a dog.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat, for being a Puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear knight?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI have no exquisite reason for\u2019t, but I have reason good enough.\n\nMARIA.\nThe devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a\ntime-pleaser, an affectioned ass that cons state without book and\nutters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed\n(as he thinks) with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith that\nall that look on him love him. And on that vice in him will my revenge\nfind notable cause to work.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat wilt thou do?\n\nMARIA.\nI will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love, wherein by the\ncolour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the\nexpressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself\nmost feelingly personated. I can write very like my lady your niece; on\na forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nExcellent! I smell a device.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI have\u2019t in my nose too.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHe shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from\nmy niece, and that she is in love with him.\n\nMARIA.\nMy purpose is indeed a horse of that colour.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd your horse now would make him an ass.\n\nMARIA.\nAss, I doubt not.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nO \u2019twill be admirable!\n\nMARIA.\nSport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with him. I will\nplant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the\nletter. Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and\ndream on the event. Farewell.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGood night, Penthesilea.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nBefore me, she\u2019s a good wench.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nShe\u2019s a beagle true bred, and one that adores me. What o\u2019 that?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI was adored once too.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nLet\u2019s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nIf I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nSend for money, knight; if thou hast her not i\u2019 th\u2019 end, call me cut.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nIf I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome, come, I\u2019ll go burn some sack, \u2019tis too late to go to bed now.\nCome, knight, come, knight.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Room in the Duke\u2019s Palace.\n\n Enter Duke, Viola, Curio and others.\n\nDUKE.\nGive me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.\nNow, good Cesario, but that piece of song,\nThat old and antique song we heard last night;\nMethought it did relieve my passion much,\nMore than light airs and recollected terms\nOf these most brisk and giddy-paced times.\nCome, but one verse.\n\nCURIO.\nHe is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.\n\nDUKE.\nWho was it?\n\nCURIO.\nFeste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the Lady Olivia\u2019s father took\nmuch delight in. He is about the house.\n\nDUKE.\nSeek him out, and play the tune the while.\n\n [_Exit Curio. Music plays._]\n\nCome hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,\nIn the sweet pangs of it remember me:\nFor such as I am, all true lovers are,\nUnstaid and skittish in all motions else,\nSave in the constant image of the creature\nThat is belov\u2019d. How dost thou like this tune?\n\nVIOLA.\nIt gives a very echo to the seat\nWhere love is throned.\n\nDUKE.\nThou dost speak masterly.\nMy life upon\u2019t, young though thou art, thine eye\nHath stayed upon some favour that it loves.\nHath it not, boy?\n\nVIOLA.\nA little, by your favour.\n\nDUKE.\nWhat kind of woman is\u2019t?\n\nVIOLA.\nOf your complexion.\n\nDUKE.\nShe is not worth thee, then. What years, i\u2019 faith?\n\nVIOLA.\nAbout your years, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nToo old, by heaven! Let still the woman take\nAn elder than herself; so wears she to him,\nSo sways she level in her husband\u2019s heart.\nFor, boy, however we do praise ourselves,\nOur fancies are more giddy and unfirm,\nMore longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,\nThan women\u2019s are.\n\nVIOLA.\nI think it well, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nThen let thy love be younger than thyself,\nOr thy affection cannot hold the bent:\nFor women are as roses, whose fair flower\nBeing once display\u2019d, doth fall that very hour.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd so they are: alas, that they are so;\nTo die, even when they to perfection grow!\n\n Enter Curio and Clown.\n\nDUKE.\nO, fellow, come, the song we had last night.\nMark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;\nThe spinsters and the knitters in the sun,\nAnd the free maids, that weave their thread with bones\nDo use to chant it: it is silly sooth,\nAnd dallies with the innocence of love\nLike the old age.\n\nCLOWN.\nAre you ready, sir?\n\nDUKE.\nAy; prithee, sing.\n\n [_Music._]\n\n The Clown\u2019s song.\n\n_    Come away, come away, death.\n    And in sad cypress let me be laid.\n    Fly away, fly away, breath;\n    I am slain by a fair cruel maid.\n       My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,\n         O, prepare it!\n       My part of death no one so true\n         Did share it._\n\n_    Not a flower, not a flower sweet,\n    On my black coffin let there be strown:\n    Not a friend, not a friend greet\n    My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown:\n       A thousand thousand sighs to save,\n         Lay me, O, where\n       Sad true lover never find my grave,\n         To weep there._\n\nDUKE.\nThere\u2019s for thy pains.\n\nCLOWN.\nNo pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir.\n\nDUKE.\nI\u2019ll pay thy pleasure, then.\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another.\n\nDUKE.\nGive me now leave to leave thee.\n\nCLOWN.\nNow the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of\nchangeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of\nsuch constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything, and\ntheir intent everywhere, for that\u2019s it that always makes a good voyage\nof nothing. Farewell.\n\n [_Exit Clown._]\n\nDUKE.\nLet all the rest give place.\n\n [_Exeunt Curio and Attendants._]\n\nOnce more, Cesario,\nGet thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.\nTell her my love, more noble than the world,\nPrizes not quantity of dirty lands;\nThe parts that fortune hath bestow\u2019d upon her,\nTell her I hold as giddily as fortune;\nBut \u2019tis that miracle and queen of gems\nThat nature pranks her in attracts my soul.\n\nVIOLA.\nBut if she cannot love you, sir?\n\nDUKE.\nI cannot be so answer\u2019d.\n\nVIOLA.\nSooth, but you must.\nSay that some lady, as perhaps there is,\nHath for your love as great a pang of heart\nAs you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;\nYou tell her so. Must she not then be answer\u2019d?\n\nDUKE.\nThere is no woman\u2019s sides\nCan bide the beating of so strong a passion\nAs love doth give my heart: no woman\u2019s heart\nSo big, to hold so much; they lack retention.\nAlas, their love may be called appetite,\nNo motion of the liver, but the palate,\nThat suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;\nBut mine is all as hungry as the sea,\nAnd can digest as much. Make no compare\nBetween that love a woman can bear me\nAnd that I owe Olivia.\n\nVIOLA.\nAy, but I know\u2014\n\nDUKE.\nWhat dost thou know?\n\nVIOLA.\nToo well what love women to men may owe.\nIn faith, they are as true of heart as we.\nMy father had a daughter loved a man,\nAs it might be perhaps, were I a woman,\nI should your lordship.\n\nDUKE.\nAnd what\u2019s her history?\n\nVIOLA.\nA blank, my lord. She never told her love,\nBut let concealment, like a worm i\u2019 th\u2019 bud,\nFeed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,\nAnd with a green and yellow melancholy\nShe sat like patience on a monument,\nSmiling at grief. Was not this love, indeed?\nWe men may say more, swear more, but indeed,\nOur shows are more than will; for still we prove\nMuch in our vows, but little in our love.\n\nDUKE.\nBut died thy sister of her love, my boy?\n\nVIOLA.\nI am all the daughters of my father\u2019s house,\nAnd all the brothers too: and yet I know not.\nSir, shall I to this lady?\n\nDUKE.\nAy, that\u2019s the theme.\nTo her in haste. Give her this jewel; say\nMy love can give no place, bide no denay.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Olivia\u2019s garden.\n\n Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome thy ways, Signior Fabian.\n\nFABIAN.\nNay, I\u2019ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to\ndeath with melancholy.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter\ncome by some notable shame?\n\nFABIAN.\nI would exult, man. You know he brought me out o\u2019 favour with my lady\nabout a bear-baiting here.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTo anger him we\u2019ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and\nblue, shall we not, Sir Andrew?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd we do not, it is pity of our lives.\n\n Enter Maria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHere comes the little villain. How now, my metal of India?\n\nMARIA.\nGet ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolio\u2019s coming down this walk;\nhe has been yonder i\u2019 the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow\nthis half hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this\nletter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name of\njesting! [_The men hide themselves._] Lie thou there; [_Throws down a\nletter_] for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.\n\n [_Exit Maria._]\n\n Enter Malvolio.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2019Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me,\nand I have heard herself come thus near, that should she fancy, it\nshould be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more\nexalted respect than anyone else that follows her. What should I think\non\u2019t?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHere\u2019s an overweening rogue!\n\nFABIAN.\nO, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him; how he jets\nunder his advanced plumes!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n\u2019Slight, I could so beat the rogue!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPeace, I say.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nTo be Count Malvolio.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAh, rogue!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nPistol him, pistol him.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPeace, peace.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nThere is example for\u2019t. The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of\nthe wardrobe.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nFie on him, Jezebel!\n\nFABIAN.\nO, peace! now he\u2019s deeply in; look how imagination blows him.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nHaving been three months married to her, sitting in my state\u2014\n\nSIR TOBY.\nO for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nCalling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown; having come\nfrom a day-bed, where I have left Olivia sleeping.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nFire and brimstone!\n\nFABIAN.\nO, peace, peace.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAnd then to have the humour of state; and after a demure travel of\nregard, telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs,\nto ask for my kinsman Toby.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nBolts and shackles!\n\nFABIAN.\nO, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSeven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown\nthe while, and perchance wind up my watch, or play with some rich\njewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me\u2014\n\nSIR TOBY.\nShall this fellow live?\n\nFABIAN.\nThough our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an\naustere regard of control\u2014\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd does not Toby take you a blow o\u2019 the lips then?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSaying \u2018Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece, give me\nthis prerogative of speech\u2014\u2019\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat, what?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018You must amend your drunkenness.\u2019\n\nSIR TOBY.\nOut, scab!\n\nFABIAN.\nNay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight\u2014\u2019\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nThat\u2019s me, I warrant you.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018One Sir Andrew.\u2019\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI knew \u2019twas I, for many do call me fool.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n[_Taking up the letter._] What employment have we here?\n\nFABIAN.\nNow is the woodcock near the gin.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nO, peace! And the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to him!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nBy my life, this is my lady\u2019s hand: these be her very C\u2019s, her U\u2019s, and\nher T\u2019s, and thus makes she her great P\u2019s. It is in contempt of\nquestion, her hand.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nHer C\u2019s, her U\u2019s, and her T\u2019s. Why that?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n[_Reads._] _To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes._ Her very\nphrases! By your leave, wax.

Why, this is evident to any formal capacity. There is\nno obstruction in this. And the end\u2014what should that alphabetical\nposition portend?

The cur is excellent at faults.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018M\u2019\u2014But then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that suffers under\nprobation: \u2018A\u2019 should follow, but \u2018O\u2019 does.\n\nFABIAN.\nAnd \u2018O\u2019 shall end, I hope.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAy, or I\u2019ll cudgel him, and make him cry \u2018O!\u2019\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAnd then \u2018I\u2019 comes behind.\n\nFABIAN.\nAy, and you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at\nyour heels than fortunes before you.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018M.O.A.I.\u2019 This simulation is not as the former: and yet, to crush this\na little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my\nname. Soft, here follows prose.\n[_Reads._] _If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above\nthee, but be not afraid of greatness.

I do not\nnow fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites\nto this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of\nlate, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this she\nmanifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction, drives me\nto these habits of her liking. I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be\nstrange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the\nswiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised!\u2014Here is yet a\npostscript.

If you will see it, follow me.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTo the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI\u2019ll make one too.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT III.\n\nSCENE I. Olivia\u2019s garden.\n\n Enter Viola and Clown with a tabor.\n\nVIOLA.\nSave thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thy tabor?\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, sir, I live by the church.\n\nVIOLA.\nArt thou a churchman?\n\nCLOWN.\nNo such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I do live at my\nhouse, and my house doth stand by the church.\n\nVIOLA.\nSo thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near\nhim; or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the\nchurch.\n\nCLOWN.\nYou have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a chev\u2019ril glove\nto a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!\n\nVIOLA.\nNay, that\u2019s certain; they that dally nicely with words may quickly make\nthem wanton.\n\nCLOWN.\nI would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.\n\nVIOLA.\nWhy, man?\n\nCLOWN.\nWhy, sir, her name\u2019s a word; and to dally with that word might make my\nsister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals, since bonds\ndisgraced them.\n\nVIOLA.\nThy reason, man?\n\nCLOWN.\nTroth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so\nfalse, I am loath to prove reason with them.\n\nVIOLA.\nI warrant thou art a merry fellow, and car\u2019st for nothing.\n\nCLOWN.\nNot so, sir, I do care for something. But in my conscience, sir, I do\nnot care for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would\nmake you invisible.\n\nVIOLA.\nArt not thou the Lady Olivia\u2019s fool?\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly. She will keep no fool,\nsir, till she be married, and fools are as like husbands as pilchards\nare to herrings, the husband\u2019s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool,\nbut her corrupter of words.\n\nVIOLA.\nI saw thee late at the Count Orsino\u2019s.\n\nCLOWN.\nFoolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines\neverywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with\nyour master as with my mistress. I think I saw your wisdom there.\n\nVIOLA.\nNay, and thou pass upon me, I\u2019ll no more with thee. Hold, there\u2019s\nexpenses for thee.\n\nCLOWN.\nNow Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!\n\nVIOLA.\nBy my troth, I\u2019ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one, though I would\nnot have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?\n\nCLOWN.\nWould not a pair of these have bred, sir?\n\nVIOLA.\nYes, being kept together, and put to use.\n\nCLOWN.\nI would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this\nTroilus.\n\nVIOLA.\nI understand you, sir; \u2019tis well begged.\n\nCLOWN.\nThe matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida\nwas a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you\ncome; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin. I might say\n\u201celement\u201d, but the word is overworn.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nVIOLA.\nThis fellow is wise enough to play the fool,\nAnd to do that well, craves a kind of wit:\nHe must observe their mood on whom he jests,\nThe quality of persons, and the time,\nAnd like the haggard, check at every feather\nThat comes before his eye. This is a practice\nAs full of labour as a wise man\u2019s art:\nFor folly, that he wisely shows, is fit;\nBut wise men, folly-fall\u2019n, quite taint their wit.\n\n Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nSave you, gentleman.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd you, sir.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n_Dieu vous garde, monsieur._\n\nVIOLA.\n_Et vous aussi; votre serviteur._\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWill you encounter the house? My niece is desirous you should enter, if\nyour trade be to her.\n\nVIOLA.\nI am bound to your niece, sir, I mean, she is the list of my voyage.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTaste your legs, sir, put them to motion.\n\nVIOLA.\nMy legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean\nby bidding me taste my legs.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI mean, to go, sir, to enter.\n\nVIOLA.\nI will answer you with gait and entrance: but we are prevented.\n\n Enter Olivia and Maria.\n\nMost excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nThat youth\u2019s a rare courtier. \u2018Rain odours,\u2019 well.\n\nVIOLA.\nMy matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and\nvouchsafed car.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n\u2018Odours,\u2019 \u2018pregnant,\u2019 and \u2018vouchsafed.\u2019\u2014I\u2019ll get \u2019em all three ready.\n\nOLIVIA.\nLet the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.\n\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Maria._]\n\nGive me your hand, sir.\n\nVIOLA.\nMy duty, madam, and most humble service.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat is your name?\n\nVIOLA.\nCesario is your servant\u2019s name, fair princess.\n\nOLIVIA.\nMy servant, sir! \u2019Twas never merry world,\nSince lowly feigning was call\u2019d compliment:\nY\u2019are servant to the Count Orsino, youth.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd he is yours, and his must needs be yours.\nYour servant\u2019s servant is your servant, madam.\n\nOLIVIA.\nFor him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,\nWould they were blanks rather than fill\u2019d with me!\n\nVIOLA.\nMadam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts\nOn his behalf.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, by your leave, I pray you.\nI bade you never speak again of him.\nBut would you undertake another suit,\nI had rather hear you to solicit that\nThan music from the spheres.\n\nVIOLA.\nDear lady\u2014\n\nOLIVIA.\nGive me leave, beseech you. I did send,\nAfter the last enchantment you did here,\nA ring in chase of you. So did I abuse\nMyself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.\nUnder your hard construction must I sit;\nTo force that on you in a shameful cunning,\nWhich you knew none of yours. What might you think?\nHave you not set mine honour at the stake,\nAnd baited it with all th\u2019 unmuzzled thoughts\nThat tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving\nEnough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom,\nHides my heart: so let me hear you speak.\n\nVIOLA.\nI pity you.\n\nOLIVIA.\nThat\u2019s a degree to love.\n\nVIOLA.\nNo, not a grize; for \u2019tis a vulgar proof\nThat very oft we pity enemies.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhy then methinks \u2019tis time to smile again.\nO world, how apt the poor are to be proud!\nIf one should be a prey, how much the better\nTo fall before the lion than the wolf! [_Clock strikes._]\nThe clock upbraids me with the waste of time.\nBe not afraid, good youth, I will not have you.\nAnd yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,\nYour wife is like to reap a proper man.\nThere lies your way, due west.\n\nVIOLA.\nThen westward ho!\nGrace and good disposition attend your ladyship!\nYou\u2019ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?\n\nOLIVIA.\nStay:\nI prithee tell me what thou think\u2019st of me.\n\nVIOLA.\nThat you do think you are not what you are.\n\nOLIVIA.\nIf I think so, I think the same of you.\n\nVIOLA.\nThen think you right; I am not what I am.\n\nOLIVIA.\nI would you were as I would have you be.\n\nVIOLA.\nWould it be better, madam, than I am?\nI wish it might, for now I am your fool.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO what a deal of scorn looks beautiful\nIn the contempt and anger of his lip!\nA murd\u2019rous guilt shows not itself more soon\nThan love that would seem hid. Love\u2019s night is noon.\nCesario, by the roses of the spring,\nBy maidhood, honour, truth, and everything,\nI love thee so, that maugre all thy pride,\nNor wit nor reason can my passion hide.\nDo not extort thy reasons from this clause,\nFor that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;\nBut rather reason thus with reason fetter:\nLove sought is good, but given unsought is better.\n\nVIOLA.\nBy innocence I swear, and by my youth,\nI have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,\nAnd that no woman has; nor never none\nShall mistress be of it, save I alone.\nAnd so adieu, good madam; never more\nWill I my master\u2019s tears to you deplore.\n\nOLIVIA.\nYet come again: for thou perhaps mayst move\nThat heart, which now abhors, to like his love.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. A Room in Olivia\u2019s House.\n\n Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nNo, faith, I\u2019ll not stay a jot longer.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.\n\nFABIAN.\nYou must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nMarry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count\u2019s servingman than\never she bestowed upon me; I saw\u2019t i\u2019 th\u2019 orchard.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nDid she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAs plain as I see you now.\n\nFABIAN.\nThis was a great argument of love in her toward you.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n\u2019Slight! will you make an ass o\u2019 me?\n\nFABIAN.\nI will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.\n\nFABIAN.\nShe did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you,\nto awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone\nin your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some\nexcellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the\nyouth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was\nbalked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and\nyou are now sailed into the north of my lady\u2019s opinion; where you will\nhang like an icicle on Dutchman\u2019s beard, unless you do redeem it by\nsome laudable attempt, either of valour or policy.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd\u2019t be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate; I had as\nlief be a Brownist as a politician.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me\nthe Count\u2019s youth to fight with him. Hurt him in eleven places; my\nniece shall take note of it, and assure thyself there is no love-broker\nin the world can more prevail in man\u2019s commendation with woman than\nreport of valour.\n\nFABIAN.\nThere is no way but this, Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWill either of you bear me a challenge to him?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGo, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief; it is no matter how\nwitty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the\nlicence of ink. If thou \u2018thou\u2019st\u2019 him some thrice, it shall not be\namiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the\nsheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set \u2019em down. Go\nabout it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a\ngoose-pen, no matter. About it.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWhere shall I find you?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWe\u2019ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.\n\n [_Exit Sir Andrew._]\n\nFABIAN.\nThis is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.\n\nFABIAN.\nWe shall have a rare letter from him; but you\u2019ll not deliver it.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nNever trust me then. And by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I\nthink oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he\nwere opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the\nfoot of a flea, I\u2019ll eat the rest of th\u2019 anatomy.\n\nFABIAN.\nAnd his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of\ncruelty.\n\n Enter Maria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nLook where the youngest wren of nine comes.\n\nMARIA.\nIf you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches,\nfollow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for\nthere is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can\never believe such impossible passages of grossness. He\u2019s in yellow\nstockings.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd cross-gartered?\n\nMARIA.\nMost villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i\u2019 th\u2019 church. I\nhave dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the\nletter that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face into more\nlines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You\nhave not seen such a thing as \u2019tis. I  can hardly forbear hurling\nthings at him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he\u2019ll smile\nand take\u2019t for a great favour.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome, bring us, bring us where he is.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. A street.\n\n Enter Sebastian and Antonio.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI would not by my will have troubled you,\nBut since you make your pleasure of your pains,\nI will no further chide you.\n\nANTONIO.\nI could not stay behind you: my desire,\nMore sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;\nAnd not all love to see you, though so much,\nAs might have drawn one to a longer voyage,\nBut jealousy what might befall your travel,\nBeing skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,\nUnguided and unfriended, often prove\nRough and unhospitable. My willing love,\nThe rather by these arguments of fear,\nSet forth in your pursuit.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nMy kind Antonio,\nI can no other answer make but thanks,\nAnd thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns\nAre shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.\nBut were my worth, as is my conscience, firm,\nYou should find better dealing. What\u2019s to do?\nShall we go see the relics of this town?\n\nANTONIO.\nTomorrow, sir; best first go see your lodging.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI am not weary, and \u2019tis long to night;\nI pray you, let us satisfy our eyes\nWith the memorials and the things of fame\nThat do renown this city.\n\nANTONIO.\nWould you\u2019d pardon me.\nI do not without danger walk these streets.\nOnce in a sea-fight, \u2019gainst the Count his galleys,\nI did some service, of such note indeed,\nThat were I ta\u2019en here, it would scarce be answer\u2019d.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nBelike you slew great number of his people.\n\nANTONIO.\nTh\u2019 offence is not of such a bloody nature,\nAlbeit the quality of the time and quarrel\nMight well have given us bloody argument.\nIt might have since been answered in repaying\nWhat we took from them, which for traffic\u2019s sake,\nMost of our city did. Only myself stood out,\nFor which, if I be lapsed in this place,\nI shall pay dear.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nDo not then walk too open.\n\nANTONIO.\nIt doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here\u2019s my purse.\nIn the south suburbs, at the Elephant,\nIs best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet\nWhiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge\nWith viewing of the town. There shall you have me.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhy I your purse?\n\nANTONIO.\nHaply your eye shall light upon some toy\nYou have desire to purchase; and your store,\nI think, is not for idle markets, sir.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI\u2019ll be your purse-bearer, and leave you for an hour.\n\nANTONIO.\nTo th\u2019 Elephant.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI do remember.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. Olivia\u2019s garden.\n\n Enter Olivia and Maria.\n\nOLIVIA.\nI have sent after him. He says he\u2019ll come;\nHow shall I feast him? What bestow of him?\nFor youth is bought more oft than begg\u2019d or borrow\u2019d.\nI speak too loud.\u2014\nWhere\u2019s Malvolio?\u2014He is sad and civil,\nAnd suits well for a servant with my fortunes;\nWhere is Malvolio?\n\nMARIA.\nHe\u2019s coming, madam:\nBut in very strange manner. He is sure possessed, madam.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhy, what\u2019s the matter? Does he rave?\n\nMARIA.\nNo, madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have\nsome guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in \u2019s\nwits.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGo call him hither. I\u2019m as mad as he,\nIf sad and merry madness equal be.\n\n Enter Malvolio.\n\nHow now, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSweet lady, ho, ho!\n\nOLIVIA.\nSmil\u2019st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the\nblood, this cross-gartering. But what of that? If it please the eye of\none, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: \u2018Please one and please\nall.\u2019\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhy, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nNot black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his\nhands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet\nRoman hand.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nTo bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I\u2019ll come to thee.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGod comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft?\n\nMARIA.\nHow do you, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAt your request? Yes, nightingales answer daws!\n\nMARIA.\nWhy appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018Be not afraid of greatness.\u2019 \u2019Twas well writ.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat mean\u2019st thou by that, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018Some are born great\u2019\u2014\n\nOLIVIA.\nHa?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018Some achieve greatness\u2019\u2014\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat say\u2019st thou?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018And some have greatness thrust upon them.\u2019\n\nOLIVIA.\nHeaven restore thee!\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018Remember who commended thy yellow stockings\u2019\u2014\n\nOLIVIA.\nThy yellow stockings?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018And wished to see thee cross-gartered.\u2019\n\nOLIVIA.\nCross-gartered?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018Go to: thou art made, if thou desir\u2019st to be so:\u2019\u2014\n\nOLIVIA.\nAm I made?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n\u2018If not, let me see thee a servant still.\u2019\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhy, this is very midsummer madness.\n\n Enter Servant.\n\nSERVANT.\nMadam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino\u2019s is returned; I could\nhardly entreat him back. He attends your ladyship\u2019s pleasure.\n\nOLIVIA.\nI\u2019ll come to him.\n\n [_Exit Servant._]\n\nGood Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where\u2019s my cousin Toby? Let\nsome of my people have a special care of him; I would not have him\nmiscarry for the half of my dowry.\n\n [_Exeunt Olivia and Maria._]\n\nMALVOLIO.\nO ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to\nme. This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose,\nthat I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the\nletter. \u2018Cast thy humble slough,\u2019 says she; \u2018be opposite with a\nkinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of\nstate, put thyself into the trick of singularity,\u2019 and consequently,\nsets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow\ntongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed\nher, but it is Jove\u2019s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she\nwent away now, \u2018Let this fellow be looked to;\u2019 \u2018Fellow!\u2019 not\n\u2018Malvolio\u2019, nor after my degree, but \u2018fellow\u2019. Why, everything adheres\ntogether, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no\nobstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance. What can be said?\nNothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my\nhopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.\n\n Enter Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhich way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be\ndrawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I\u2019ll speak to\nhim.\n\nFABIAN.\nHere he is, here he is. How is\u2019t with you, sir? How is\u2019t with you, man?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nGo off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my private. Go off.\n\nMARIA.\nLo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! Did not I tell you? Sir\nToby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAh, ha! does she so?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGo to, go to; peace, peace, we must deal gently with him. Let me alone.\nHow do you, Malvolio? How is\u2019t with you? What, man! defy the devil!\nConsider, he\u2019s an enemy to mankind.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nDo you know what you say?\n\nMARIA.\nLa you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart! Pray\nGod he be not bewitched.\n\nFABIAN.\nCarry his water to th\u2019 wise woman.\n\nMARIA.\nMarry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning, if I live. My lady would\nnot lose him for more than I\u2019ll say.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nHow now, mistress!\n\nMARIA.\nO Lord!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPrithee hold thy peace, this is not the way. Do you not see you move\nhim? Let me alone with him.\n\nFABIAN.\nNo way but gentleness, gently, gently. The fiend is rough, and will not\nbe roughly used.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, how now, my bawcock? How dost thou, chuck?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAy, biddy, come with me. What, man, \u2019tis not for gravity to play at\ncherry-pit with Satan. Hang him, foul collier!\n\nMARIA.\nGet him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMy prayers, minx?\n\nMARIA.\nNo, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nGo, hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow things. I am not of your\nelement. You shall know more hereafter.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nIs\u2019t possible?\n\nFABIAN.\nIf this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an\nimprobable fiction.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHis very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.\n\nMARIA.\nNay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.\n\nFABIAN.\nWhy, we shall make him mad indeed.\n\nMARIA.\nThe house will be the quieter.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome, we\u2019ll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is already in\nthe belief that he\u2019s mad. We may carry it thus for our pleasure, and\nhis penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to\nhave mercy on him, at which time we will bring the device to the bar,\nand crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see!\n\n Enter Sir Andrew.\n\nFABIAN.\nMore matter for a May morning.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nHere\u2019s the challenge, read it. I warrant there\u2019s vinegar and pepper\nin\u2019t.\n\nFABIAN.\nIs\u2019t so saucy?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAy, is\u2019t, I warrant him. Do but read.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGive me. [_Reads._] _Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy\nfellow._\n\nFABIAN.\nGood, and valiant.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n_Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I\nwill show thee no reason for\u2019t._\n\nFABIAN.\nA good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n_Thou comest to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly:\nbut thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee\nfor._\n\nFABIAN.\nVery brief, and to exceeding good sense\u2014less.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n_I will waylay thee going home; where if it be thy chance to kill me\u2014_\n\nFABIAN.\nGood.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n_Thou kill\u2019st me like a rogue and a villain._\n\nFABIAN.\nStill you keep o\u2019 th\u2019 windy side of the law. Good.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n_Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls! He may have\nmercy upon mine, but my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy\nfriend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,\n                        Andrew Aguecheek._\nIf this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I\u2019ll give\u2019t him.\n\nMARIA.\nYou may have very fit occasion for\u2019t. He is now in some commerce with\nmy lady, and will by and by depart.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGo, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner of the orchard, like a\nbum-baily. So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw\u2019st,\nswear horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a\nswaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation\nthan ever proof itself would have earned him. Away.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nNay, let me alone for swearing.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nNow will not I deliver his letter, for the behaviour of the young\ngentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his\nemployment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore\nthis letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the\nyouth. He will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver\nhis challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of\nvalour, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive\nit) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and\nimpetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one\nanother by the look, like cockatrices.\n\n Enter Olivia and Viola.\n\nFABIAN.\nHere he comes with your niece; give them way till he take leave, and\npresently after him.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.\n\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria._]\n\nOLIVIA.\nI have said too much unto a heart of stone,\nAnd laid mine honour too unchary on\u2019t:\nThere\u2019s something in me that reproves my fault:\nBut such a headstrong potent fault it is,\nThat it but mocks reproof.\n\nVIOLA.\nWith the same \u2019haviour that your passion bears\nGoes on my master\u2019s griefs.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHere, wear this jewel for me, \u2019tis my picture.\nRefuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you.\nAnd I beseech you come again tomorrow.\nWhat shall you ask of me that I\u2019ll deny,\nThat honour sav\u2019d, may upon asking give?\n\nVIOLA.\nNothing but this, your true love for my master.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHow with mine honour may I give him that\nWhich I have given to you?\n\nVIOLA.\nI will acquit you.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWell, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well;\nA fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n Enter Sir Toby and Fabian.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGentleman, God save thee.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd you, sir.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThat defence thou hast, betake thee to\u2019t. Of what nature the wrongs are\nthou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite,\nbloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy\ntuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful,\nand deadly.\n\nVIOLA.\nYou mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me. My\nremembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to\nany man.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nYou\u2019ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold your\nlife at any price, betake you to your guard, for your opposite hath in\nhim what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal.\n\nVIOLA.\nI pray you, sir, what is he?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHe is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier, and on carpet\nconsideration, but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies\nhath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so\nimplacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and\nsepulchre. Hob, nob is his word; give\u2019t or take\u2019t.\n\nVIOLA.\nI will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady.\nI am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels\npurposely on others to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that\nquirk.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nSir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury;\ntherefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to\nthe house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety\nyou might answer him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked,\nfor meddle you must, that\u2019s certain, or forswear to wear iron about\nyou.\n\nVIOLA.\nThis is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous\noffice, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is. It is\nsomething of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my\nreturn.\n\n [_Exit Sir Toby._]\n\nVIOLA.\nPray you, sir, do you know of this matter?\n\nFABIAN.\nI know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal\narbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more.\n\nVIOLA.\nI beseech you, what manner of man is he?\n\nFABIAN.\nNothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are\nlike to find him in the proof of his valour. He is indeed, sir, the\nmost skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have\nfound in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make\nyour peace with him if I can.\n\nVIOLA.\nI shall be much bound to you for\u2019t. I am one that had rather go with\nsir priest than sir knight: I care not who knows so much of my mettle.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, man, he\u2019s a very devil. I have not seen such a firago. I had a\npass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in\nwith such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he\npays you as surely as your feet hits the ground they step on. They say\nhe has been fencer to the Sophy.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nPox on\u2019t, I\u2019ll not meddle with him.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAy, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nPlague on\u2019t, an I thought he had been valiant, and so cunning in fence,\nI\u2019d have seen him damned ere I\u2019d have challenged him. Let him let the\nmatter slip, and I\u2019ll give him my horse, grey Capilet.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI\u2019ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on\u2019t. This shall end\nwithout the perdition of souls. [_Aside._] Marry, I\u2019ll ride your horse\nas well as I ride you.\n\n Enter Fabian and Viola.\n\n[_To Fabian._] I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have\npersuaded him the youth\u2019s a devil.\n\nFABIAN.\nHe is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and looks pale, as if a\nbear were at his heels.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThere\u2019s no remedy, sir, he will fight with you for\u2019s oath sake. Marry,\nhe hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now\nscarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for the supportance of\nhis vow; he protests he will not hurt you.\n\nVIOLA.\n[_Aside._] Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them\nhow much I lack of a man.\n\nFABIAN.\nGive ground if you see him furious.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome, Sir Andrew, there\u2019s no remedy, the gentleman will for his\nhonour\u2019s sake have one bout with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it;\nbut he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not\nhurt you. Come on: to\u2019t.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n[_Draws._] Pray God he keep his oath!\n\n Enter Antonio.\n\nVIOLA.\n[_Draws._] I do assure you \u2019tis against my will.\n\nANTONIO.\nPut up your sword. If this young gentleman\nHave done offence, I take the fault on me.\nIf you offend him, I for him defy you.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nYou, sir? Why, what are you?\n\nANTONIO.\n[_Draws._] One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more\nThan you have heard him brag to you he will.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[_Draws._] Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.\n\n Enter Officers.\n\nFABIAN.\nO good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[_To Antonio._] I\u2019ll be with you anon.\n\nVIOLA.\n[_To Sir Andrew._] Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nMarry, will I, sir; and for that I promised you, I\u2019ll be as good as my\nword. He will bear you easily, and reins well.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nThis is the man; do thy office.\n\nSECOND OFFICER.\nAntonio, I arrest thee at the suit\nOf Count Orsino.\n\nANTONIO.\nYou do mistake me, sir.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nNo, sir, no jot. I know your favour well,\nThough now you have no sea-cap on your head.\u2014\nTake him away, he knows I know him well.\n\nANTONIO.\nI must obey. This comes with seeking you;\nBut there\u2019s no remedy, I shall answer it.\nWhat will you do? Now my necessity\nMakes me to ask you for my purse. It grieves me\nMuch more for what I cannot do for you,\nThan what befalls myself. You stand amaz\u2019d,\nBut be of comfort.\n\nSECOND OFFICER.\nCome, sir, away.\n\nANTONIO.\nI must entreat of you some of that money.\n\nVIOLA.\nWhat money, sir?\nFor the fair kindness you have show\u2019d me here,\nAnd part being prompted by your present trouble,\nOut of my lean and low ability\nI\u2019ll lend you something. My having is not much;\nI\u2019ll make division of my present with you.\nHold, there\u2019s half my coffer.\n\nANTONIO.\nWill you deny me now?\nIs\u2019t possible that my deserts to you\nCan lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,\nLest that it make me so unsound a man\nAs to upbraid you with those kindnesses\nThat I have done for you.\n\nVIOLA.\nI know of none,\nNor know I you by voice or any feature.\nI hate ingratitude more in a man\nThan lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,\nOr any taint of vice whose strong corruption\nInhabits our frail blood.\n\nANTONIO.\nO heavens themselves!\n\nSECOND OFFICER.\nCome, sir, I pray you go.\n\nANTONIO.\nLet me speak a little. This youth that you see here\nI snatch\u2019d one half out of the jaws of death,\nReliev\u2019d him with such sanctity of love;\nAnd to his image, which methought did promise\nMost venerable worth, did I devotion.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nWhat\u2019s that to us? The time goes by. Away!\n\nANTONIO.\nBut O how vile an idol proves this god!\nThou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.\nIn nature there\u2019s no blemish but the mind;\nNone can be call\u2019d deform\u2019d but the unkind.\nVirtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil\nAre empty trunks, o\u2019erflourished by the devil.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nThe man grows mad, away with him. Come, come, sir.\n\nANTONIO.\nLead me on.\n\n [_Exeunt Officers with Antonio._]\n\nVIOLA.\nMethinks his words do from such passion fly\nThat he believes himself; so do not I.\nProve true, imagination, O prove true,\nThat I, dear brother, be now ta\u2019en for you!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome hither, knight; come hither, Fabian. We\u2019ll whisper o\u2019er a couplet\nor two of most sage saws.\n\nVIOLA.\nHe nam\u2019d Sebastian. I my brother know\nYet living in my glass; even such and so\nIn favour was my brother, and he went\nStill in this fashion, colour, ornament,\nFor him I imitate. O if it prove,\nTempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nA very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare. His\ndishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity, and denying\nhim; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian.\n\nFABIAN.\nA coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n\u2019Slid, I\u2019ll after him again and beat him.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nDo, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd I do not\u2014\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nFABIAN.\nCome, let\u2019s see the event.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI dare lay any money \u2019twill be nothing yet.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT IV.\n\nSCENE I. The Street before Olivia\u2019s House.\n\n Enter Sebastian and Clown.\n\nCLOWN.\nWill you make me believe that I am not sent for you?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nGo to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow.\nLet me be clear of thee.\n\nCLOWN.\nWell held out, i\u2019 faith! No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to\nyou by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your name is not\nMaster Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so, is\nso.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI prithee vent thy folly somewhere else,\nThou know\u2019st not me.\n\nCLOWN.\nVent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and now\napplies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the\nworld, will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness, and\ntell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art\ncoming?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.\nThere\u2019s money for thee; if you tarry longer\nI shall give worse payment.\n\nCLOWN.\nBy my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give fools\nmoney get themselves a good report\u2014after fourteen years\u2019 purchase.\n\n Enter Sir Andrew, Sir Toby and Fabian.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nNow sir, have I met you again? There\u2019s for you.\n\n [_Striking Sebastian._]\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhy, there\u2019s for thee, and there, and there.\nAre all the people mad?\n\n [_Beating Sir Andrew._]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHold, sir, or I\u2019ll throw your dagger o\u2019er the house.\n\nCLOWN.\nThis will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of your coats\nfor twopence.\n\n [_Exit Clown._]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome on, sir, hold!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nNay, let him alone, I\u2019ll go another way to work with him. I\u2019ll have an\naction of battery against him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I\nstruck him first, yet it\u2019s no matter for that.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nLet go thy hand!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your\niron: you are well fleshed. Come on.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now?\nIf thou dar\u2019st tempt me further, draw thy sword.\n\n [_Draws._]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat, what? Nay, then, I must have an ounce or two of this malapert\nblood from you.\n\n [_Draws._]\n\n Enter Olivia.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHold, Toby! On thy life I charge thee hold!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nMadam.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWill it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,\nFit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,\nWhere manners ne\u2019er were preach\u2019d! Out of my sight!\nBe not offended, dear Cesario.\nRudesby, be gone!\n\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian._]\n\nI prithee, gentle friend,\nLet thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway\nIn this uncivil and unjust extent\nAgainst thy peace. Go with me to my house,\nAnd hear thou there how many fruitless pranks\nThis ruffian hath botch\u2019d up, that thou thereby\nMayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go.\nDo not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,\nHe started one poor heart of mine, in thee.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhat relish is in this? How runs the stream?\nOr I am mad, or else this is a dream.\nLet fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;\nIf it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!\n\nOLIVIA.\nNay, come, I prithee. Would thou\u2019dst be ruled by me!\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nMadam, I will.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, say so, and so be!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II.

I\u2019ll call Sir Toby the whilst.\n\n [_Exit Maria._]\n\nCLOWN.\nWell, I\u2019ll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in\u2019t, and I would I\nwere the first that ever dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall\nenough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a\ngood student, but to be said, an honest man and a good housekeeper goes\nas fairly as to say, a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors\nenter.\n\n Enter Sir Toby and Maria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nJove bless thee, Master Parson.\n\nCLOWN.\n_Bonos dies_, Sir Toby: for as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw\npen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, \u2018That that\nis, is\u2019: so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for what is\n\u2018that\u2019 but \u2018that\u2019? and \u2018is\u2019 but \u2018is\u2019?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTo him, Sir Topas.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhat ho, I say! Peace in this prison!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThe knave counterfeits well. A good knave.\n\nMalvolio within.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nWho calls there?\n\nCLOWN.\nSir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.\n\nCLOWN.\nOut, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man? Talkest thou nothing\nbut of ladies?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWell said, Master Parson.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I\nam mad. They have laid me here in hideous darkness.\n\nCLOWN.\nFie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I\nam one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with\ncourtesy. Say\u2019st thou that house is dark?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAs hell, Sir Topas.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhy, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the\nclerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet\ncomplainest thou of obstruction?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark.\n\nCLOWN.\nMadman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness but ignorance, in which\nthou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI say this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark\nas hell; and I say there was never man thus abused. I am no more mad\nthan you are. Make the trial of it in any constant question.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhat is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nThat the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhat think\u2019st thou of his opinion?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.\n\nCLOWN.\nFare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness. Thou shalt hold the\nopinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a\nwoodcock, lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir Topas, Sir Topas!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nMy most exquisite Sir Topas!\n\nCLOWN.\nNay, I am for all waters.\n\nMARIA.\nThou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown. He sees thee\nnot.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTo him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou find\u2019st him. I\nwould we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently\ndelivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offence with my\nniece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot.\nCome by and by to my chamber.\n\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby and Maria._]\n\nCLOWN.\n[_Singing._]\n    _Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,\n    Tell me how thy lady does._\n\nMALVOLIO.\nFool!\n\nCLOWN.\n    _My lady is unkind, perdy._\n\nMALVOLIO.\nFool!\n\nCLOWN.\n    _Alas, why is she so?_\n\nMALVOLIO.\nFool, I say!\n\nCLOWN.\n    _She loves another_\u2014\nWho calls, ha?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nGood fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a\ncandle, and pen, ink, and paper.

I am as well in my\nwits, fool, as thou art.\n\nCLOWN.\nBut as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits\nthan a fool.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nThey have here propertied me; keep me in darkness, send ministers to\nme, asses, and do all they can to face me out of my wits.\n\nCLOWN.\nAdvise you what you say: the minister is here. [_As Sir Topas_]\nMalvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore. Endeavour thyself to\nsleep, and leave thy vain bibble-babble.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir Topas!\n\nCLOWN.\n[_As Sir Topas_] Maintain no words with him, good fellow. [_As\nhimself_] Who, I, sir? not I, sir. God buy you, good Sir Topas. [_As\nSir Topas_] Marry, amen. [_As himself_] I will sir, I will.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nFool, fool, fool, I say!\n\nCLOWN.\nAlas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am shent for speaking to\nyou.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nGood fool, help me to some light and some paper. I tell thee I am as\nwell in my wits as any man in Illyria.\n\nCLOWN.\nWell-a-day that you were, sir!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nBy this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey\nwhat I will set down to my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever\nthe bearing of letter did.\n\nCLOWN.\nI will help you to\u2019t. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed? or do\nyou but counterfeit?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nBelieve me, I am not.

Where\u2019s Antonio, then?\nI could not find him at the Elephant,\nYet there he was, and there I found this credit,\nThat he did range the town to seek me out.\nHis counsel now might do me golden service.\nFor though my soul disputes well with my sense\nThat this may be some error, but no madness,\nYet doth this accident and flood of fortune\nSo far exceed all instance, all discourse,\nThat I am ready to distrust mine eyes\nAnd wrangle with my reason that persuades me\nTo any other trust but that I am mad,\nOr else the lady\u2019s mad; yet if \u2019twere so,\nShe could not sway her house, command her followers,\nTake and give back affairs and their dispatch,\nWith such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing\nAs I perceive she does. There\u2019s something in\u2019t\nThat is deceivable. But here the lady comes.\n\n Enter Olivia and a Priest.\n\nOLIVIA.\nBlame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,\nNow go with me and with this holy man\nInto the chantry by: there, before him\nAnd underneath that consecrated roof,\nPlight me the full assurance of your faith,\nThat my most jealous and too doubtful soul\nMay live at peace.

How dost thou, my good fellow?\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly, sir, the better for my foes, and the worse for my friends.\n\nDUKE.\nJust the contrary; the better for thy friends.\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, sir, the worse.\n\nDUKE.\nHow can that be?\n\nCLOWN.\nMarry, sir, they praise me, and make an ass of me. Now my foes tell me\nplainly I am an ass: so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge\nof myself, and by my friends I am abused. So that, conclusions to be as\nkisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then,\nthe worse for my friends, and the better for my foes.\n\nDUKE.\nWhy, this is excellent.\n\nCLOWN.\nBy my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my friends.\n\nDUKE.\nThou shalt not be the worse for me; there\u2019s gold.\n\nCLOWN.\nBut that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it\nanother.\n\nDUKE.\nO, you give me ill counsel.\n\nCLOWN.\nPut your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh\nand blood obey it.\n\nDUKE.\nWell, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer: there\u2019s\nanother.\n\nCLOWN.\n_Primo, secundo, tertio_, is a good play, and the old saying is, the\nthird pays for all; the triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure; or\nthe bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind\u2014one, two, three.\n\nDUKE.\nYou can fool no more money out of me at this throw. If you will let\nyour lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with\nyou, it may awake my bounty further.\n\nCLOWN.\nMarry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir, but I\nwould not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of\ncovetousness: but as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will\nawake it anon.\n\n [_Exit Clown._]\n\n Enter Antonio and Officers.\n\nVIOLA.\nHere comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.\n\nDUKE.\nThat face of his I do remember well.\nYet when I saw it last it was besmear\u2019d\nAs black as Vulcan, in the smoke of war.\nA baubling vessel was he captain of,\nFor shallow draught and bulk unprizable,\nWith which such scathful grapple did he make\nWith the most noble bottom of our fleet,\nThat very envy and the tongue of loss\nCried fame and honour on him.

A witchcraft drew me hither:\nThat most ingrateful boy there by your side\nFrom the rude sea\u2019s enraged and foamy mouth\nDid I redeem; a wreck past hope he was.\nHis life I gave him, and did thereto add\nMy love, without retention or restraint,\nAll his in dedication. For his sake\nDid I expose myself, pure for his love,\nInto the danger of this adverse town;\nDrew to defend him when he was beset;\nWhere being apprehended, his false cunning\n(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)\nTaught him to face me out of his acquaintance,\nAnd grew a twenty years\u2019 removed thing\nWhile one would wink; denied me mine own purse,\nWhich I had recommended to his use\nNot half an hour before.\n\nVIOLA.\nHow can this be?\n\nDUKE.\nWhen came he to this town?\n\nANTONIO.\nToday, my lord; and for three months before,\nNo int\u2019rim, not a minute\u2019s vacancy,\nBoth day and night did we keep company.\n\n Enter Olivia and Attendants.\n\nDUKE.\nHere comes the Countess, now heaven walks on earth.\nBut for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness.\nThree months this youth hath tended upon me;\nBut more of that anon.

Good my lord\u2014\n\nVIOLA.\nMy lord would speak, my duty hushes me.\n\nOLIVIA.\nIf it be aught to the old tune, my lord,\nIt is as fat and fulsome to mine ear\nAs howling after music.\n\nDUKE.\nStill so cruel?\n\nOLIVIA.\nStill so constant, lord.\n\nDUKE.\nWhat, to perverseness? You uncivil lady,\nTo whose ingrate and unauspicious altars\nMy soul the faithfull\u2019st off\u2019rings hath breathed out\nThat e\u2019er devotion tender\u2019d! What shall I do?\n\nOLIVIA.\nEven what it please my lord that shall become him.\n\nDUKE.\nWhy should I not, had I the heart to do it,\nLike to the Egyptian thief at point of death,\nKill what I love?\u2014a savage jealousy\nThat sometime savours nobly. But hear me this:\nSince you to non-regardance cast my faith,\nAnd that I partly know the instrument\nThat screws me from my true place in your favour,\nLive you the marble-breasted tyrant still.\nBut this your minion, whom I know you love,\nAnd whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,\nHim will I tear out of that cruel eye\nWhere he sits crowned in his master\u2019s spite.\u2014\nCome, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:\nI\u2019ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,\nTo spite a raven\u2019s heart within a dove.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,\nTo do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhere goes Cesario?\n\nVIOLA.\nAfter him I love\nMore than I love these eyes, more than my life,\nMore, by all mores, than e\u2019er I shall love wife.\nIf I do feign, you witnesses above\nPunish my life for tainting of my love.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAh me, detested! how am I beguil\u2019d!\n\nVIOLA.\nWho does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?\n\nOLIVIA.\nHast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?\nCall forth the holy father.\n\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\n\nDUKE.\n[_To Viola._] Come, away!\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhither, my lord?

What wilt thou be\nWhen time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?\nOr will not else thy craft so quickly grow\nThat thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?\nFarewell, and take her; but direct thy feet\nWhere thou and I henceforth may never meet.\n\nVIOLA.\nMy lord, I do protest\u2014\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, do not swear.\nHold little faith, though thou has too much fear.\n\n Enter Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nFor the love of God, a surgeon!

I had rather than forty pound I were at\nhome.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWho has done this, Sir Andrew?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nThe Count\u2019s gentleman, one Cesario.

I never hurt you:\nYou drew your sword upon me without cause,\nBut I bespake you fair and hurt you not.\n\n Enter Sir Toby, drunk, led by the Clown.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nIf a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me. I think you set\nnothing by a bloody coxcomb.

How is\u2019t with you?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThat\u2019s all one; \u2019has hurt me, and there\u2019s th\u2019 end on\u2019t.

I hate a drunken rogue.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAway with him. Who hath made this havoc with them?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI\u2019ll help you, Sir Toby, because we\u2019ll be dressed together.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWill you help?

I leave my duty a little unthought\nof, and speak out of my injury.\n                        The madly-used Malvolio._\n\nOLIVIA.\nDid he write this?\n\nCLOWN.\nAy, madam.\n\nDUKE.\nThis savours not much of distraction.\n\nOLIVIA.\nSee him delivered, Fabian, bring him hither.\n\n [_Exit Fabian._]\n\nMy lord, so please you, these things further thought on,\nTo think me as well a sister, as a wife,\nOne day shall crown th\u2019 alliance on\u2019t, so please you,\nHere at my house, and at my proper cost.\n\nDUKE.\nMadam, I am most apt t\u2019 embrace your offer.\n[_To Viola._] Your master quits you; and for your service done him,\nSo much against the mettle of your sex,\nSo far beneath your soft and tender breeding,\nAnd since you call\u2019d me master for so long,\nHere is my hand; you shall from this time be\nYou master\u2019s mistress.\n\nOLIVIA.\nA sister? You are she.\n\n Enter Fabian and Malvolio.\n\nDUKE.\nIs this the madman?\n\nOLIVIA.\nAy, my lord, this same.\nHow now, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMadam, you have done me wrong,\nNotorious wrong.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHave I, Malvolio? No.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nLady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.\nYou must not now deny it is your hand,\nWrite from it, if you can, in hand, or phrase,\nOr say \u2019tis not your seal, not your invention:\nYou can say none of this. Well, grant it then,\nAnd tell me, in the modesty of honour,\nWhy you have given me such clear lights of favour,\nBade me come smiling and cross-garter\u2019d to you,\nTo put on yellow stockings, and to frown\nUpon Sir Toby, and the lighter people;\nAnd acting this in an obedient hope,\nWhy have you suffer\u2019d me to be imprison\u2019d,\nKept in a dark house, visited by the priest,\nAnd made the most notorious geck and gull\nThat e\u2019er invention played on? Tell me why?\n\nOLIVIA.\nAlas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,\nThough I confess, much like the character:\nBut out of question, \u2019tis Maria\u2019s hand.\nAnd now I do bethink me, it was she\nFirst told me thou wast mad; then cam\u2019st in smiling,\nAnd in such forms which here were presuppos\u2019d\nUpon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.\nThis practice hath most shrewdly pass\u2019d upon thee.\nBut when we know the grounds and authors of it,\nThou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge\nOf thine own cause.\n\nFABIAN.\nGood madam, hear me speak,\nAnd let no quarrel, nor no brawl to come,\nTaint the condition of this present hour,\nWhich I have wonder\u2019d at. In hope it shall not,\nMost freely I confess, myself and Toby\nSet this device against Malvolio here,\nUpon some stubborn and uncourteous parts\nWe had conceiv\u2019d against him. Maria writ\nThe letter, at Sir Toby\u2019s great importance,\nIn recompense whereof he hath married her.\nHow with a sportful malice it was follow\u2019d\nMay rather pluck on laughter than revenge,\nIf that the injuries be justly weigh\u2019d\nThat have on both sides passed.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAlas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!\n\nCLOWN.\nWhy, \u2018some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have\ngreatness thrown upon them.\u2019 I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir\nTopas, sir, but that\u2019s all one. \u2018By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.\u2019 But\ndo you remember? \u2018Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? And you\nsmile not, he\u2019s gagged\u2019? And thus the whirligig of time brings in his\nrevenges.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI\u2019ll be revenged on the whole pack of you.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nOLIVIA.\nHe hath been most notoriously abus\u2019d.\n\nDUKE.\nPursue him, and entreat him to a peace:\nHe hath not told us of the captain yet.\nWhen that is known, and golden time convents,\nA solemn combination shall be made\nOf our dear souls.\u2014Meantime, sweet sister,\nWe will not part from hence.\u2014Cesario, come:\nFor so you shall be while you are a man;\nBut when in other habits you are seen,\nOrsino\u2019s mistress, and his fancy\u2019s queen.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n Clown sings.\n\n_   When that I was and a little tiny boy,\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n   A foolish thing was but a toy,\n     For the rain it raineth every day._\n\n_   But when I came to man\u2019s estate,\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n   \u2019Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,\n     For the rain it raineth every day._\n\n_   But when I came, alas, to wive,\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n   By swaggering could I never thrive,\n     For the rain it raineth every day._\n\n_   But when I came unto my beds,\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n   With toss-pots still had drunken heads,\n     For the rain it raineth every day._\n\n_   A great while ago the world begun,\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n   But that\u2019s all one, our play is done,\n     And we\u2019ll strive to please you every day._\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\n"
