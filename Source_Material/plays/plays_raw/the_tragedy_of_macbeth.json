A Camp near Forres.\n\n Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with\n Attendants, meeting a bleeding Captain.\n\nDUNCAN.\nWhat bloody man is that? He can report,\nAs seemeth by his plight, of the revolt\nThe newest state.\n\nMALCOLM.\nThis is the sergeant\nWho, like a good and hardy soldier, fought\n\u2019Gainst my captivity.\u2014Hail, brave friend!\nSay to the King the knowledge of the broil\nAs thou didst leave it.\n\nSOLDIER.\nDoubtful it stood;\nAs two spent swimmers that do cling together\nAnd choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald\n(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that\nThe multiplying villainies of nature\nDo swarm upon him) from the Western Isles\nOf kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;\nAnd Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,\nShow\u2019d like a rebel\u2019s whore. But all\u2019s too weak;\nFor brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),\nDisdaining Fortune, with his brandish\u2019d steel,\nWhich smok\u2019d with bloody execution,\nLike Valour\u2019s minion, carv\u2019d out his passage,\nTill he fac\u2019d the slave;\nWhich ne\u2019er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,\nTill he unseam\u2019d him from the nave to the chops,\nAnd fix\u2019d his head upon our battlements.\n\nDUNCAN.\nO valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!\n\nSOLDIER.\nAs whence the sun \u2019gins his reflection\nShipwracking storms and direful thunders break,\nSo from that spring, whence comfort seem\u2019d to come\nDiscomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:\nNo sooner justice had, with valour arm\u2019d,\nCompell\u2019d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,\nBut the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,\nWith furbish\u2019d arms and new supplies of men,\nBegan a fresh assault.\n\nDUNCAN.\nDismay\u2019d not this\nOur captains, Macbeth and Banquo?\n\nSOLDIER.\nYes;\nAs sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.\nIf I say sooth, I must report they were\nAs cannons overcharg\u2019d with double cracks;\nSo they\nDoubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:\nExcept they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,\nOr memorize another Golgotha,\nI cannot tell\u2014\nBut I am faint, my gashes cry for help.\n\nDUNCAN.\nSo well thy words become thee as thy wounds:\nThey smack of honour both.\u2014Go, get him surgeons.\n\n [_Exit Captain, attended._]\n\n Enter Ross and Angus.\n\nWho comes here?\n\nMALCOLM.\nThe worthy Thane of Ross.\n\nLENNOX.\nWhat a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look\nThat seems to speak things strange.\n\nROSS.\nGod save the King!\n\nDUNCAN.\nWhence cam\u2019st thou, worthy thane?\n\nROSS.\nFrom Fife, great King,\nWhere the Norweyan banners flout the sky\nAnd fan our people cold.\nNorway himself, with terrible numbers,\nAssisted by that most disloyal traitor,\nThe Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;\nTill that Bellona\u2019s bridegroom, lapp\u2019d in proof,\nConfronted him with self-comparisons,\nPoint against point, rebellious arm \u2019gainst arm,\nCurbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,\nThe victory fell on us.\n\nDUNCAN.\nGreat happiness!\n\nROSS.\nThat now\nSweno, the Norways\u2019 king, craves composition;\nNor would we deign him burial of his men\nTill he disbursed at Saint Colme\u2019s Inch\nTen thousand dollars to our general use.\n\nDUNCAN.\nNo more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive\nOur bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,\nAnd with his former title greet Macbeth.\n\nROSS.\nI\u2019ll see it done.\n\nDUNCAN.\nWhat he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. A heath.\n\n Thunder. Enter the three Witches.\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nWhere hast thou been, sister?\n\nSECOND WITCH.\nKilling swine.\n\nTHIRD WITCH.\nSister, where thou?\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nA sailor\u2019s wife had chestnuts in her lap,\nAnd mounch\u2019d, and mounch\u2019d, and mounch\u2019d. \u201cGive me,\u201d quoth I.\n\u201cAroint thee, witch!\u201d the rump-fed ronyon cries.\nHer husband\u2019s to Aleppo gone, master o\u2019 th\u2019 _Tiger:_\nBut in a sieve I\u2019ll thither sail,\nAnd, like a rat without a tail,\nI\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll do, and I\u2019ll do.\n\nSECOND WITCH.\nI\u2019ll give thee a wind.\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nTh\u2019art kind.\n\nTHIRD WITCH.\nAnd I another.\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nI myself have all the other,\nAnd the very ports they blow,\nAll the quarters that they know\nI\u2019 the shipman\u2019s card.\nI will drain him dry as hay:\nSleep shall neither night nor day\nHang upon his pent-house lid;\nHe shall live a man forbid.\nWeary sev\u2019n-nights nine times nine,\nShall he dwindle, peak, and pine:\nThough his bark cannot be lost,\nYet it shall be tempest-tost.\nLook what I have.\n\nSECOND WITCH.\nShow me, show me.\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nHere I have a pilot\u2019s thumb,\nWrack\u2019d as homeward he did come.\n\n [_Drum within._]\n\nTHIRD WITCH.\nA drum, a drum!\nMacbeth doth come.\n\nALL.\nThe Weird Sisters, hand in hand,\nPosters of the sea and land,\nThus do go about, about:\nThrice to thine, and thrice to mine,\nAnd thrice again, to make up nine.\nPeace!\u2014the charm\u2019s wound up.\n\n Enter Macbeth and Banquo.\n\nMACBETH.\nSo foul and fair a day I have not seen.\n\nBANQUO.\nHow far is\u2019t call\u2019d to Forres?\u2014What are these,\nSo wither\u2019d, and so wild in their attire,\nThat look not like the inhabitants o\u2019 th\u2019 earth,\nAnd yet are on\u2019t?\u2014Live you? or are you aught\nThat man may question? You seem to understand me,\nBy each at once her choppy finger laying\nUpon her skinny lips. You should be women,\nAnd yet your beards forbid me to interpret\nThat you are so.\n\nMACBETH.\nSpeak, if you can;\u2014what are you?\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nAll hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!\n\nSECOND WITCH.\nAll hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!\n\nTHIRD WITCH.\nAll hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!\n\nBANQUO.\nGood sir, why do you start and seem to fear\nThings that do sound so fair?\u2014I\u2019 th\u2019 name of truth,\nAre ye fantastical, or that indeed\nWhich outwardly ye show? My noble partner\nYou greet with present grace and great prediction\nOf noble having and of royal hope,\nThat he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.\nIf you can look into the seeds of time,\nAnd say which grain will grow, and which will not,\nSpeak then to me, who neither beg nor fear\nYour favours nor your hate.\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nHail!\n\nSECOND WITCH.\nHail!\n\nTHIRD WITCH.\nHail!\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nLesser than Macbeth, and greater.\n\nSECOND WITCH.\nNot so happy, yet much happier.\n\nTHIRD WITCH.\nThou shalt get kings, though thou be none:\nSo all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nBanquo and Macbeth, all hail!\n\nMACBETH.\nStay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.\nBy Sinel\u2019s death I know I am Thane of Glamis;\nBut how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,\nA prosperous gentleman; and to be king\nStands not within the prospect of belief,\nNo more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence\nYou owe this strange intelligence? or why\nUpon this blasted heath you stop our way\nWith such prophetic greeting?\u2014Speak, I charge you.\n\n [_Witches vanish._]\n\nBANQUO.\nThe earth hath bubbles, as the water has,\nAnd these are of them. Whither are they vanish\u2019d?\n\nMACBETH.\nInto the air; and what seem\u2019d corporal,\nMelted as breath into the wind.\nWould they had stay\u2019d!\n\nBANQUO.\nWere such things here as we do speak about?\nOr have we eaten on the insane root\nThat takes the reason prisoner?\n\nMACBETH.\nYour children shall be kings.\n\nBANQUO.\nYou shall be king.\n\nMACBETH.\nAnd Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?\n\nBANQUO.\nTo the selfsame tune and words. Who\u2019s here?\n\n Enter Ross and Angus.\n\nROSS.\nThe King hath happily receiv\u2019d, Macbeth,\nThe news of thy success, and when he reads\nThy personal venture in the rebels\u2019 fight,\nHis wonders and his praises do contend\nWhich should be thine or his: silenc\u2019d with that,\nIn viewing o\u2019er the rest o\u2019 th\u2019 selfsame day,\nHe finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,\nNothing afeard of what thyself didst make,\nStrange images of death. As thick as tale\nCame post with post; and everyone did bear\nThy praises in his kingdom\u2019s great defence,\nAnd pour\u2019d them down before him.\n\nANGUS.\nWe are sent\nTo give thee from our royal master thanks;\nOnly to herald thee into his sight,\nNot pay thee.\n\nROSS.\nAnd, for an earnest of a greater honour,\nHe bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:\nIn which addition, hail, most worthy thane,\nFor it is thine.\n\nBANQUO.\nWhat, can the devil speak true?\n\nMACBETH.\nThe Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me\nIn borrow\u2019d robes?\n\nANGUS.\nWho was the Thane lives yet,\nBut under heavy judgement bears that life\nWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin\u2019d\nWith those of Norway, or did line the rebel\nWith hidden help and vantage, or that with both\nHe labour\u2019d in his country\u2019s wrack, I know not;\nBut treasons capital, confess\u2019d and prov\u2019d,\nHave overthrown him.\n\nMACBETH.\n[_Aside._] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:\nThe greatest is behind. [_To Ross and Angus._] Thanks for your pains.\n[_To Banquo._] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,\nWhen those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me\nPromis\u2019d no less to them?\n\nBANQUO.\nThat, trusted home,\nMight yet enkindle you unto the crown,\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But \u2019tis strange:\nAnd oftentimes to win us to our harm,\nThe instruments of darkness tell us truths;\nWin us with honest trifles, to betray\u2019s\nIn deepest consequence.\u2014\nCousins, a word, I pray you.\n\nMACBETH.\n[_Aside._] Two truths are told,\nAs happy prologues to the swelling act\nOf the imperial theme.\u2014I thank you, gentlemen.\u2014\n[_Aside._] This supernatural soliciting\nCannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,\nWhy hath it given me earnest of success,\nCommencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:\nIf good, why do I yield to that suggestion\nWhose horrid image doth unfix my hair,\nAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs,\nAgainst the use of nature? Present fears\nAre less than horrible imaginings.\nMy thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,\nShakes so my single state of man\nThat function is smother\u2019d in surmise,\nAnd nothing is but what is not.\n\nBANQUO.\nLook, how our partner\u2019s rapt.\n\nMACBETH.\n[_Aside._] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me\nWithout my stir.\n\nBANQUO.\nNew honours come upon him,\nLike our strange garments, cleave not to their mould\nBut with the aid of use.\n\nMACBETH.\n[_Aside._] Come what come may,\nTime and the hour runs through the roughest day.\n\nBANQUO.\nWorthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.\n\nMACBETH.\nGive me your favour. My dull brain was wrought\nWith things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains\nAre register\u2019d where every day I turn\nThe leaf to read them.\u2014Let us toward the King.\u2014\nThink upon what hath chanc\u2019d; and at more time,\nThe interim having weigh\u2019d it, let us speak\nOur free hearts each to other.\n\nBANQUO.\nVery gladly.\n\nMACBETH.\nTill then, enough.\u2014Come, friends.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. Forres. A Room in the Palace.\n\n Flourish. Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox and Attendants.\n\nDUNCAN.\nIs execution done on Cawdor? Are not\nThose in commission yet return\u2019d?\n\nMALCOLM.\nMy liege,\nThey are not yet come back. But I have spoke\nWith one that saw him die, who did report,\nThat very frankly he confess\u2019d his treasons,\nImplor\u2019d your Highness\u2019 pardon, and set forth\nA deep repentance. Nothing in his life\nBecame him like the leaving it; he died\nAs one that had been studied in his death,\nTo throw away the dearest thing he ow\u2019d\nAs \u2019twere a careless trifle.\n\nDUNCAN.\nThere\u2019s no art\nTo find the mind\u2019s construction in the face:\nHe was a gentleman on whom I built\nAn absolute trust.\n\n Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross and Angus.\n\nO worthiest cousin!\nThe sin of my ingratitude even now\nWas heavy on me. Thou art so far before,\nThat swiftest wing of recompense is slow\nTo overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv\u2019d;\nThat the proportion both of thanks and payment\nMight have been mine! only I have left to say,\nMore is thy due than more than all can pay.\n\nMACBETH.\nThe service and the loyalty I owe,\nIn doing it, pays itself. Your Highness\u2019 part\nIs to receive our duties: and our duties\nAre to your throne and state, children and servants;\nWhich do but what they should, by doing everything\nSafe toward your love and honour.\n\nDUNCAN.\nWelcome hither:\nI have begun to plant thee, and will labour\nTo make thee full of growing.\u2014Noble Banquo,\nThat hast no less deserv\u2019d, nor must be known\nNo less to have done so, let me infold thee\nAnd hold thee to my heart.\n\nBANQUO.\nThere if I grow,\nThe harvest is your own.\n\nDUNCAN.\nMy plenteous joys,\nWanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves\nIn drops of sorrow.\u2014Sons, kinsmen, thanes,\nAnd you whose places are the nearest, know,\nWe will establish our estate upon\nOur eldest, Malcolm; whom we name hereafter\nThe Prince of Cumberland: which honour must\nNot unaccompanied invest him only,\nBut signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine\nOn all deservers.\u2014From hence to Inverness,\nAnd bind us further to you.\n\nMACBETH.\nThe rest is labour, which is not us\u2019d for you:\nI\u2019ll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful\nThe hearing of my wife with your approach;\nSo, humbly take my leave.\n\nDUNCAN.\nMy worthy Cawdor!\n\nMACBETH.\n[_Aside._] The Prince of Cumberland!\u2014That is a step\nOn which I must fall down, or else o\u2019erleap,\nFor in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires!\nLet not light see my black and deep desires.\nThe eye wink at the hand, yet let that be,\nWhich the eye fears, when it is done, to see.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nDUNCAN.\nTrue, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant;\nAnd in his commendations I am fed.\nIt is a banquet to me. Let\u2019s after him,\nWhose care is gone before to bid us welcome:\nIt is a peerless kinsman.\n\n [_Flourish. Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Inverness. A Room in Macbeth\u2019s Castle.\n\n Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\n\u201cThey met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the\nperfect\u2019st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I\nburned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air,\ninto which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came\nmissives from the King, who all-hailed me, \u2018Thane of Cawdor\u2019; by which\ntitle, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the\ncoming on of time, with \u2018Hail, king that shalt be!\u2019 This have I thought\ngood to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou\nmight\u2019st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what\ngreatness is promis\u2019d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.\u201d\n\nGlamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be\nWhat thou art promis\u2019d. Yet do I fear thy nature;\nIt is too full o\u2019 th\u2019 milk of human kindness\nTo catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;\nArt not without ambition, but without\nThe illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,\nThat wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,\nAnd yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou\u2019dst have, great Glamis,\nThat which cries, \u201cThus thou must do,\u201d if thou have it;\nAnd that which rather thou dost fear to do,\nThan wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,\nThat I may pour my spirits in thine ear,\nAnd chastise with the valour of my tongue\nAll that impedes thee from the golden round,\nWhich fate and metaphysical aid doth seem\nTo have thee crown\u2019d withal.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nWhat is your tidings?\n\nMESSENGER.\nThe King comes here tonight.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nThou\u2019rt mad to say it.\nIs not thy master with him? who, were\u2019t so,\nWould have inform\u2019d for preparation.\n\nMESSENGER.\nSo please you, it is true. Our thane is coming.\nOne of my fellows had the speed of him,\nWho, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more\nThan would make up his message.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nGive him tending.\nHe brings great news.\n\n [_Exit Messenger._]\n\nThe raven himself is hoarse\nThat croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan\nUnder my battlements. Come, you spirits\nThat tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,\nAnd fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full\nOf direst cruelty! make thick my blood,\nStop up th\u2019 access and passage to remorse,\nThat no compunctious visitings of nature\nShake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between\nTh\u2019 effect and it! Come to my woman\u2019s breasts,\nAnd take my milk for gall, your murd\u2019ring ministers,\nWherever in your sightless substances\nYou wait on nature\u2019s mischief! Come, thick night,\nAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell\nThat my keen knife see not the wound it makes,\nNor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark\nTo cry, \u201cHold, hold!\u201d\n\n Enter Macbeth.\n\nGreat Glamis, worthy Cawdor!\nGreater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!\nThy letters have transported me beyond\nThis ignorant present, and I feel now\nThe future in the instant.\n\nMACBETH.\nMy dearest love,\nDuncan comes here tonight.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nAnd when goes hence?\n\nMACBETH.\nTomorrow, as he purposes.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nO, never\nShall sun that morrow see!\nYour face, my thane, is as a book where men\nMay read strange matters. To beguile the time,\nLook like the time; bear welcome in your eye,\nYour hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,\nBut be the serpent under\u2019t. He that\u2019s coming\nMust be provided for; and you shall put\nThis night\u2019s great business into my dispatch;\nWhich shall to all our nights and days to come\nGive solely sovereign sway and masterdom.\n\nMACBETH.\nWe will speak further.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nOnly look up clear;\nTo alter favour ever is to fear.\nLeave all the rest to me.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. The same. Before the Castle.\n\n Hautboys. Servants of Macbeth attending.\n\n Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross, Angus\n and Attendants.\n\nDUNCAN.\nThis castle hath a pleasant seat. The air\nNimbly and sweetly recommends itself\nUnto our gentle senses.\n\nBANQUO.\nThis guest of summer,\nThe temple-haunting martlet, does approve,\nBy his loved mansionry, that the heaven\u2019s breath\nSmells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,\nButtress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird\nhath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.\nWhere they most breed and haunt, I have observ\u2019d\nThe air is delicate.\n\n Enter Lady Macbeth.\n\nDUNCAN.\nSee, see, our honour\u2019d hostess!\u2014\nThe love that follows us sometime is our trouble,\nWhich still we thank as love. Herein I teach you\nHow you shall bid God \u2019ild us for your pains,\nAnd thank us for your trouble.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nAll our service,\nIn every point twice done, and then done double,\nWere poor and single business to contend\nAgainst those honours deep and broad wherewith\nYour Majesty loads our house: for those of old,\nAnd the late dignities heap\u2019d up to them,\nWe rest your hermits.\n\nDUNCAN.\nWhere\u2019s the Thane of Cawdor?\nWe cours\u2019d him at the heels, and had a purpose\nTo be his purveyor: but he rides well;\nAnd his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him\nTo his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,\nWe are your guest tonight.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nYour servants ever\nHave theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,\nTo make their audit at your Highness\u2019 pleasure,\nStill to return your own.\n\nDUNCAN.\nGive me your hand;\nConduct me to mine host: we love him highly,\nAnd shall continue our graces towards him.\nBy your leave, hostess.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VII. The same. A Lobby in the Castle.\n\n Hautboys and torches. Enter, and pass over, a Sewer and divers\n Servants with dishes and service. Then enter Macbeth.\n\nMACBETH.\nIf it were done when \u2019tis done, then \u2019twere well\nIt were done quickly. If th\u2019 assassination\nCould trammel up the consequence, and catch\nWith his surcease success; that but this blow\nMight be the be-all and the end-all\u2014here,\nBut here, upon this bank and shoal of time,\nWe\u2019d jump the life to come. But in these cases\nWe still have judgement here; that we but teach\nBloody instructions, which being taught, return\nTo plague th\u2019 inventor. This even-handed justice\nCommends th\u2019 ingredience of our poison\u2019d chalice\nTo our own lips. He\u2019s here in double trust:\nFirst, as I am his kinsman and his subject,\nStrong both against the deed; then, as his host,\nWho should against his murderer shut the door,\nNot bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan\nHath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\nSo clear in his great office, that his virtues\nWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against\nThe deep damnation of his taking-off;\nAnd pity, like a naked new-born babe,\nStriding the blast, or heaven\u2019s cherubin, hors\u2019d\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air,\nShall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\nThat tears shall drown the wind.\u2014I have no spur\nTo prick the sides of my intent, but only\nVaulting ambition, which o\u2019erleaps itself\nAnd falls on th\u2019 other\u2014\n\n Enter Lady Macbeth.\n\nHow now! what news?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nHe has almost supp\u2019d. Why have you left the chamber?\n\nMACBETH.\nHath he ask\u2019d for me?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nKnow you not he has?\n\nMACBETH.\nWe will proceed no further in this business:\nHe hath honour\u2019d me of late; and I have bought\nGolden opinions from all sorts of people,\nWhich would be worn now in their newest gloss,\nNot cast aside so soon.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWas the hope drunk\nWherein you dress\u2019d yourself? Hath it slept since?\nAnd wakes it now, to look so green and pale\nAt what it did so freely? From this time\nSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeard\nTo be the same in thine own act and valour\nAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\nWhich thou esteem\u2019st the ornament of life,\nAnd live a coward in thine own esteem,\nLetting \u201cI dare not\u201d wait upon \u201cI would,\u201d\nLike the poor cat i\u2019 th\u2019 adage?\n\nMACBETH.\nPr\u2019ythee, peace!\nI dare do all that may become a man;\nWho dares do more is none.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWhat beast was\u2019t, then,\nThat made you break this enterprise to me?\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man;\nAnd, to be more than what you were, you would\nBe so much more the man. Nor time nor place\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\nThey have made themselves, and that their fitness now\nDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and know\nHow tender \u2019tis to love the babe that milks me:\nI would, while it was smiling in my face,\nHave pluck\u2019d my nipple from his boneless gums\nAnd dash\u2019d the brains out, had I so sworn as you\nHave done to this.\n\nMACBETH.\nIf we should fail?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWe fail?\nBut screw your courage to the sticking-place,\nAnd we\u2019ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep\n(Whereto the rather shall his day\u2019s hard journey\nSoundly invite him), his two chamberlains\nWill I with wine and wassail so convince\nThat memory, the warder of the brain,\nShall be a fume, and the receipt of reason\nA limbeck only: when in swinish sleep\nTheir drenched natures lie as in a death,\nWhat cannot you and I perform upon\nTh\u2019 unguarded Duncan? what not put upon\nHis spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt\nOf our great quell?\n\nMACBETH.\nBring forth men-children only;\nFor thy undaunted mettle should compose\nNothing but males. Will it not be receiv\u2019d,\nWhen we have mark\u2019d with blood those sleepy two\nOf his own chamber, and us\u2019d their very daggers,\nThat they have done\u2019t?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWho dares receive it other,\nAs we shall make our griefs and clamour roar\nUpon his death?\n\nMACBETH.\nI am settled, and bend up\nEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show:\nFalse face must hide what the false heart doth know.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT II.\n\nSCENE I.

The King\u2019s abed:\nHe hath been in unusual pleasure and\nSent forth great largess to your offices.\nThis diamond he greets your wife withal,\nBy the name of most kind hostess, and shut up\nIn measureless content.\n\nMACBETH.\nBeing unprepar\u2019d,\nOur will became the servant to defect,\nWhich else should free have wrought.\n\nBANQUO.\nAll\u2019s well.\nI dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters:\nTo you they have show\u2019d some truth.\n\nMACBETH.\nI think not of them:\nYet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,\nWe would spend it in some words upon that business,\nIf you would grant the time.\n\nBANQUO.\nAt your kind\u2019st leisure.\n\nMACBETH.\nIf you shall cleave to my consent, when \u2019tis,\nIt shall make honour for you.\n\nBANQUO.\nSo I lose none\nIn seeking to augment it, but still keep\nMy bosom franchis\u2019d, and allegiance clear,\nI shall be counsell\u2019d.\n\nMACBETH.\nGood repose the while!\n\nBANQUO.\nThanks, sir: the like to you.\n\n [_Exeunt Banquo and Fleance._]\n\nMACBETH.\nGo bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,\nShe strike upon the bell.

The sleeping and the dead\nAre but as pictures. \u2019Tis the eye of childhood\nThat fears a painted devil.

Here\u2019s a farmer that hanged himself on\nthe expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you;\nhere you\u2019ll sweat for\u2019t. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock! Who\u2019s there, i\u2019\nth\u2019 other devil\u2019s name? Faith, here\u2019s an equivocator, that could swear\nin both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough\nfor God\u2019s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in,\nequivocator. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock! Who\u2019s there? Faith,\nhere\u2019s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French\nhose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._]\nKnock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?\u2014But this place is too cold\nfor hell. I\u2019ll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let in\nsome of all professions, that go the primrose way to th\u2019 everlasting\nbonfire. [_Knocking._] Anon, anon!

Lechery, sir, it provokes\nand unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the\nperformance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with\nlechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes\nhim off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and\nnot stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him\nthe lie, leaves him.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\n\nPORTER.\nThat it did, sir, i\u2019 the very throat on me; but I requited him for his\nlie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs\nsometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.\n\nMACDUFF.\nIs thy master stirring?\n\n Enter Macbeth.\n\nOur knocking has awak\u2019d him; here he comes.\n\nLENNOX.\nGood morrow, noble sir!\n\nMACBETH.\nGood morrow, both!\n\nMACDUFF.\nIs the King stirring, worthy thane?\n\nMACBETH.\nNot yet.\n\nMACDUFF.\nHe did command me to call timely on him.\nI have almost slipp\u2019d the hour.\n\nMACBETH.\nI\u2019ll bring you to him.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI know this is a joyful trouble to you;\nBut yet \u2019tis one.\n\nMACBETH.\nThe labour we delight in physics pain.\nThis is the door.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI\u2019ll make so bold to call.\nFor \u2019tis my limited service.\n\n [_Exit Macduff._]\n\nLENNOX.\nGoes the King hence today?\n\nMACBETH.\nHe does. He did appoint so.\n\nLENNOX.\nThe night has been unruly: where we lay,\nOur chimneys were blown down and, as they say,\nLamentings heard i\u2019 th\u2019 air, strange screams of death,\nAnd prophesying, with accents terrible,\nOf dire combustion and confus\u2019d events,\nNew hatch\u2019d to the woeful time. The obscure bird\nClamour\u2019d the live-long night. Some say the earth\nWas feverous, and did shake.\n\nMACBETH.\n\u2019Twas a rough night.\n\nLENNOX.\nMy young remembrance cannot parallel\nA fellow to it.\n\n Enter Macduff.\n\nMACDUFF.\nO horror, horror, horror!\nTongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!\n\nMACBETH, LENNOX.\nWhat\u2019s the matter?\n\nMACDUFF.\nConfusion now hath made his masterpiece!\nMost sacrilegious murder hath broke ope\nThe Lord\u2019s anointed temple, and stole thence\nThe life o\u2019 th\u2019 building.\n\nMACBETH.\nWhat is\u2019t you say? the life?\n\nLENNOX.\nMean you his majesty?\n\nMACDUFF.\nApproach the chamber, and destroy your sight\nWith a new Gorgon.

Banquo!\nAs from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites\nTo countenance this horror!\n\n [_Alarum-bell rings._]\n\n Enter Lady Macbeth.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWhat\u2019s the business,\nThat such a hideous trumpet calls to parley\nThe sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!\n\nMACDUFF.\nO gentle lady,\n\u2019Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:\nThe repetition, in a woman\u2019s ear,\nWould murder as it fell.\n\n Enter Banquo.\n\nO Banquo, Banquo!\nOur royal master\u2019s murder\u2019d!\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWoe, alas!\nWhat, in our house?\n\nBANQUO.\nToo cruel anywhere.\u2014\nDear Duff, I pr\u2019ythee, contradict thyself,\nAnd say it is not so.\n\n Enter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross.\n\nMACBETH.\nHad I but died an hour before this chance,\nI had liv\u2019d a blessed time; for, from this instant\nThere\u2019s nothing serious in mortality.\nAll is but toys: renown and grace is dead;\nThe wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees\nIs left this vault to brag of.\n\n Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.\n\nDONALBAIN.\nWhat is amiss?\n\nMACBETH.\nYou are, and do not know\u2019t:\nThe spring, the head, the fountain of your blood\nIs stopp\u2019d; the very source of it is stopp\u2019d.\n\nMACDUFF.\nYour royal father\u2019s murder\u2019d.\n\nMALCOLM.\nO, by whom?\n\nLENNOX.\nThose of his chamber, as it seem\u2019d, had done\u2019t:\nTheir hands and faces were all badg\u2019d with blood;\nSo were their daggers, which, unwip\u2019d, we found\nUpon their pillows. They star\u2019d, and were distracted;\nNo man\u2019s life was to be trusted with them.\n\nMACBETH.\nO, yet I do repent me of my fury,\nThat I did kill them.\n\nMACDUFF.\nWherefore did you so?\n\nMACBETH.\nWho can be wise, amaz\u2019d, temperate, and furious,\nLoyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:\nTh\u2019 expedition of my violent love\nOutrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,\nHis silver skin lac\u2019d with his golden blood;\nAnd his gash\u2019d stabs look\u2019d like a breach in nature\nFor ruin\u2019s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,\nSteep\u2019d in the colours of their trade, their daggers\nUnmannerly breech\u2019d with gore. Who could refrain,\nThat had a heart to love, and in that heart\nCourage to make\u2019s love known?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nHelp me hence, ho!\n\nMACDUFF.\nLook to the lady.\n\nMALCOLM.\nWhy do we hold our tongues,\nThat most may claim this argument for ours?\n\nDONALBAIN.\nWhat should be spoken here, where our fate,\nHid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?\nLet\u2019s away. Our tears are not yet brew\u2019d.\n\nMALCOLM.\nNor our strong sorrow\nUpon the foot of motion.\n\nBANQUO.\nLook to the lady:\u2014\n\n [_Lady Macbeth is carried out._]\n\nAnd when we have our naked frailties hid,\nThat suffer in exposure, let us meet,\nAnd question this most bloody piece of work\nTo know it further.

Let\u2019s not consort with them:\nTo show an unfelt sorrow is an office\nWhich the false man does easy. I\u2019ll to England.\n\nDONALBAIN.\nTo Ireland, I. Our separated fortune\nShall keep us both the safer. Where we are,\nThere\u2019s daggers in men\u2019s smiles: the near in blood,\nThe nearer bloody.\n\nMALCOLM.\nThis murderous shaft that\u2019s shot\nHath not yet lighted; and our safest way\nIs to avoid the aim.

He chid the sisters\nWhen first they put the name of king upon me,\nAnd bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,\nThey hail\u2019d him father to a line of kings:\nUpon my head they plac\u2019d a fruitless crown,\nAnd put a barren sceptre in my gripe,\nThence to be wrench\u2019d with an unlineal hand,\nNo son of mine succeeding. If\u2019t be so,\nFor Banquo\u2019s issue have I fil\u2019d my mind;\nFor them the gracious Duncan have I murder\u2019d;\nPut rancours in the vessel of my peace\nOnly for them; and mine eternal jewel\nGiven to the common enemy of man,\nTo make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!\nRather than so, come, fate, into the list,\nAnd champion me to th\u2019 utterance!\u2014Who\u2019s there?\u2014\n\n Enter Servant with two Murderers.\n\nNow go to the door, and stay there till we call.\n\n [_Exit Servant._]\n\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nIt was, so please your Highness.\n\nMACBETH.\nWell then, now\nHave you consider\u2019d of my speeches? Know\nThat it was he, in the times past, which held you\nSo under fortune, which you thought had been\nOur innocent self? This I made good to you\nIn our last conference, pass\u2019d in probation with you\nHow you were borne in hand, how cross\u2019d, the instruments,\nWho wrought with them, and all things else that might\nTo half a soul and to a notion craz\u2019d\nSay, \u201cThus did Banquo.\u201d\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nYou made it known to us.\n\nMACBETH.\nI did so; and went further, which is now\nOur point of second meeting. Do you find\nYour patience so predominant in your nature,\nThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell\u2019d,\nTo pray for this good man and for his issue,\nWhose heavy hand hath bow\u2019d you to the grave,\nAnd beggar\u2019d yours forever?\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nWe are men, my liege.\n\nMACBETH.\nAy, in the catalogue ye go for men;\nAs hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\nShoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept\nAll by the name of dogs: the valu\u2019d file\nDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\nThe housekeeper, the hunter, every one\nAccording to the gift which bounteous nature\nHath in him clos\u2019d; whereby he does receive\nParticular addition, from the bill\nThat writes them all alike: and so of men.\nNow, if you have a station in the file,\nNot i\u2019 th\u2019 worst rank of manhood, say\u2019t;\nAnd I will put that business in your bosoms,\nWhose execution takes your enemy off,\nGrapples you to the heart and love of us,\nWho wear our health but sickly in his life,\nWhich in his death were perfect.\n\nSECOND MURDERER.\nI am one, my liege,\nWhom the vile blows and buffets of the world\nHath so incens\u2019d that I am reckless what\nI do to spite the world.\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nAnd I another,\nSo weary with disasters, tugg\u2019d with fortune,\nThat I would set my life on any chance,\nTo mend it or be rid on\u2019t.\n\nMACBETH.\nBoth of you\nKnow Banquo was your enemy.\n\nBOTH MURDERERS.\nTrue, my lord.\n\nMACBETH.\nSo is he mine; and in such bloody distance,\nThat every minute of his being thrusts\nAgainst my near\u2019st of life; and though I could\nWith barefac\u2019d power sweep him from my sight,\nAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\nFor certain friends that are both his and mine,\nWhose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\nWho I myself struck down: and thence it is\nThat I to your assistance do make love,\nMasking the business from the common eye\nFor sundry weighty reasons.\n\nSECOND MURDERER.\nWe shall, my lord,\nPerform what you command us.\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nThough our lives\u2014\n\nMACBETH.\nYour spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,\nI will advise you where to plant yourselves,\nAcquaint you with the perfect spy o\u2019 th\u2019 time,\nThe moment on\u2019t; for\u2019t must be done tonight\nAnd something from the palace; always thought\nThat I require a clearness. And with him\n(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)\nFleance his son, that keeps him company,\nWhose absence is no less material to me\nThan is his father\u2019s, must embrace the fate\nOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.\nI\u2019ll come to you anon.\n\nBOTH MURDERERS.\nWe are resolv\u2019d, my lord.\n\nMACBETH.\nI\u2019ll call upon you straight: abide within.\n\n [_Exeunt Murderers._]\n\nIt is concluded. Banquo, thy soul\u2019s flight,\nIf it find heaven, must find it out tonight.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II. The same. Another Room in the Palace.\n\n Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nIs Banquo gone from court?\n\nSERVANT.\nAy, madam, but returns again tonight.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nSay to the King, I would attend his leisure\nFor a few words.\n\nSERVANT.\nMadam, I will.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nNaught\u2019s had, all\u2019s spent,\nWhere our desire is got without content:\n\u2019Tis safer to be that which we destroy,\nThan by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.\n\n Enter Macbeth.\n\nHow now, my lord, why do you keep alone,\nOf sorriest fancies your companions making,\nUsing those thoughts which should indeed have died\nWith them they think on? Things without all remedy\nShould be without regard: what\u2019s done is done.\n\nMACBETH.\nWe have scorch\u2019d the snake, not kill\u2019d it.\nShe\u2019ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice\nRemains in danger of her former tooth.\nBut let the frame of things disjoint,\nBoth the worlds suffer,\nEre we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep\nIn the affliction of these terrible dreams\nThat shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,\nWhom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\nThan on the torture of the mind to lie\nIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;\nAfter life\u2019s fitful fever he sleeps well;\nTreason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,\nMalice domestic, foreign levy, nothing\nCan touch him further.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nCome on,\nGently my lord, sleek o\u2019er your rugged looks;\nBe bright and jovial among your guests tonight.\n\nMACBETH.\nSo shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.\nLet your remembrance apply to Banquo;\nPresent him eminence, both with eye and tongue:\nUnsafe the while, that we\nMust lave our honours in these flattering streams,\nAnd make our faces vizards to our hearts,\nDisguising what they are.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nYou must leave this.\n\nMACBETH.\nO, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!\nThou know\u2019st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nBut in them nature\u2019s copy\u2019s not eterne.\n\nMACBETH.\nThere\u2019s comfort yet; they are assailable.\nThen be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown\nHis cloister\u2019d flight, ere to black Hecate\u2019s summons\nThe shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,\nHath rung night\u2019s yawning peal, there shall be done\nA deed of dreadful note.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWhat\u2019s to be done?\n\nMACBETH.\nBe innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,\nTill thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,\nScarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,\nAnd with thy bloody and invisible hand\nCancel and tear to pieces that great bond\nWhich keeps me pale!\u2014Light thickens; and the crow\nMakes wing to th\u2019 rooky wood.\nGood things of day begin to droop and drowse,\nWhiles night\u2019s black agents to their preys do rouse.\nThou marvell\u2019st at my words: but hold thee still;\nThings bad begun make strong themselves by ill.\nSo, pr\u2019ythee, go with me.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. The same. A Park or Lawn, with a gate leading to the Palace.\n\n Enter three Murderers.\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nBut who did bid thee join with us?\n\nTHIRD MURDERER.\nMacbeth.\n\nSECOND MURDERER.\nHe needs not our mistrust; since he delivers\nOur offices and what we have to do\nTo the direction just.\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nThen stand with us.\nThe west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.\nNow spurs the lated traveller apace,\nTo gain the timely inn; and near approaches\nThe subject of our watch.\n\nTHIRD MURDERER.\nHark! I hear horses.\n\nBANQUO.\n[_Within._] Give us a light there, ho!\n\nSECOND MURDERER.\nThen \u2019tis he; the rest\nThat are within the note of expectation\nAlready are i\u2019 th\u2019 court.\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nHis horses go about.\n\nTHIRD MURDERER.\nAlmost a mile; but he does usually,\nSo all men do, from hence to the palace gate\nMake it their walk.\n\n Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch.\n\nSECOND MURDERER.\nA light, a light!\n\nTHIRD MURDERER.\n\u2019Tis he.\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nStand to\u2019t.\n\nBANQUO.\nIt will be rain tonight.\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nLet it come down.\n\n [_Assaults Banquo._]\n\nBANQUO.\nO, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!\nThou mayst revenge\u2014O slave!\n\n [_Dies. Fleance escapes._]\n\nTHIRD MURDERER.\nWho did strike out the light?\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nWas\u2019t not the way?\n\nTHIRD MURDERER.\nThere\u2019s but one down: the son is fled.\n\nSECOND MURDERER.\nWe have lost best half of our affair.\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nWell, let\u2019s away, and say how much is done.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. The same. A Room of state in the Palace.\n\n A banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords\n and Attendants.\n\nMACBETH.\nYou know your own degrees, sit down. At first\nAnd last the hearty welcome.\n\nLORDS.\nThanks to your Majesty.\n\nMACBETH.\nOurself will mingle with society,\nAnd play the humble host.\nOur hostess keeps her state; but, in best time,\nWe will require her welcome.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nPronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;\nFor my heart speaks they are welcome.\n\n Enter first Murderer to the door.\n\nMACBETH.\nSee, they encounter thee with their hearts\u2019 thanks.\nBoth sides are even: here I\u2019ll sit i\u2019 th\u2019 midst.\n\nBe large in mirth; anon we\u2019ll drink a measure\nThe table round. There\u2019s blood upon thy face.\n\nMURDERER.\n\u2019Tis Banquo\u2019s then.\n\nMACBETH.\n\u2019Tis better thee without than he within.\nIs he dispatch\u2019d?\n\nMURDERER.\nMy lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.\n\nMACBETH.\nThou art the best o\u2019 th\u2019 cut-throats;\nYet he\u2019s good that did the like for Fleance:\nIf thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.\n\nMURDERER.\nMost royal sir,\nFleance is \u2019scap\u2019d.\n\nMACBETH.\nThen comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;\nWhole as the marble, founded as the rock,\nAs broad and general as the casing air:\nBut now I am cabin\u2019d, cribb\u2019d, confin\u2019d, bound in\nTo saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo\u2019s safe?\n\nMURDERER.\nAy, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;\nThe least a death to nature.\n\nMACBETH.\nThanks for that.\nThere the grown serpent lies; the worm that\u2019s fled\nHath nature that in time will venom breed,\nNo teeth for th\u2019 present.\u2014Get thee gone; tomorrow\nWe\u2019ll hear, ourselves, again.\n\n [_Exit Murderer._]\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nMy royal lord,\nYou do not give the cheer: the feast is sold\nThat is not often vouch\u2019d, while \u2019tis a-making,\n\u2019Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;\nFrom thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;\nMeeting were bare without it.\n\n The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbeth\u2019s place.\n\nMACBETH.\nSweet remembrancer!\u2014\nNow, good digestion wait on appetite,\nAnd health on both!\n\nLENNOX.\nMay\u2019t please your Highness sit.\n\nMACBETH.\nHere had we now our country\u2019s honour roof\u2019d,\nWere the grac\u2019d person of our Banquo present;\nWho may I rather challenge for unkindness\nThan pity for mischance!\n\nROSS.\nHis absence, sir,\nLays blame upon his promise. Please\u2019t your Highness\nTo grace us with your royal company?\n\nMACBETH.\nThe table\u2019s full.\n\nLENNOX.\nHere is a place reserv\u2019d, sir.\n\nMACBETH.\nWhere?\n\nLENNOX.\nHere, my good lord. What is\u2019t that moves your Highness?\n\nMACBETH.\nWhich of you have done this?\n\nLORDS.\nWhat, my good lord?\n\nMACBETH.\nThou canst not say I did it. Never shake\nThy gory locks at me.\n\nROSS.\nGentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nSit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus,\nAnd hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;\nThe fit is momentary; upon a thought\nHe will again be well. If much you note him,\nYou shall offend him, and extend his passion.\nFeed, and regard him not.\u2014Are you a man?\n\nMACBETH.\nAy, and a bold one, that dare look on that\nWhich might appal the devil.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nO proper stuff!\nThis is the very painting of your fear:\nThis is the air-drawn dagger which you said,\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts\n(Impostors to true fear), would well become\nA woman\u2019s story at a winter\u2019s fire,\nAuthoris\u2019d by her grandam. Shame itself!\nWhy do you make such faces? When all\u2019s done,\nYou look but on a stool.\n\nMACBETH.\nPr\u2019ythee, see there!\nBehold! look! lo! how say you?\nWhy, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.\u2014\nIf charnel houses and our graves must send\nThose that we bury back, our monuments\nShall be the maws of kites.\n\n [_Ghost disappears._]\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWhat, quite unmann\u2019d in folly?\n\nMACBETH.\nIf I stand here, I saw him.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nFie, for shame!\n\nMACBETH.\nBlood hath been shed ere now, i\u2019 th\u2019 olden time,\nEre humane statute purg\u2019d the gentle weal;\nAy, and since too, murders have been perform\u2019d\nToo terrible for the ear: the time has been,\nThat, when the brains were out, the man would die,\nAnd there an end; but now they rise again,\nWith twenty mortal murders on their crowns,\nAnd push us from our stools. This is more strange\nThan such a murder is.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nMy worthy lord,\nYour noble friends do lack you.\n\nMACBETH.\nI do forget.\u2014\nDo not muse at me, my most worthy friends.\nI have a strange infirmity, which is nothing\nTo those that know me. Come, love and health to all;\nThen I\u2019ll sit down.\u2014Give me some wine, fill full.\u2014\nI drink to the general joy o\u2019 th\u2019 whole table,\nAnd to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss:\nWould he were here.\n\n Ghost rises again.\n\nTo all, and him, we thirst,\nAnd all to all.\n\nLORDS.\nOur duties, and the pledge.\n\nMACBETH.\nAvaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!\nThy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes\nWhich thou dost glare with!\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nThink of this, good peers,\nBut as a thing of custom: \u2019tis no other,\nOnly it spoils the pleasure of the time.\n\nMACBETH.\nWhat man dare, I dare:\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian bear,\nThe arm\u2019d rhinoceros, or th\u2019 Hyrcan tiger;\nTake any shape but that, and my firm nerves\nShall never tremble: or be alive again,\nAnd dare me to the desert with thy sword;\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest me\nThe baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!\nUnreal mock\u2019ry, hence!\n\n [_Ghost disappears._]\n\nWhy, so;\u2014being gone,\nI am a man again.\u2014Pray you, sit still.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nYou have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting\nWith most admir\u2019d disorder.\n\nMACBETH.\nCan such things be,\nAnd overcome us like a summer\u2019s cloud,\nWithout our special wonder? You make me strange\nEven to the disposition that I owe,\nWhen now I think you can behold such sights,\nAnd keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,\nWhen mine are blanch\u2019d with fear.\n\nROSS.\nWhat sights, my lord?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nI pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;\nQuestion enrages him. At once, good night:\u2014\nStand not upon the order of your going,\nBut go at once.\n\nLENNOX.\nGood night; and better health\nAttend his Majesty!\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nA kind good night to all!\n\n [_Exeunt all Lords and Atendants._]\n\nMACBETH.\nIt will have blood, they say, blood will have blood.\nStones have been known to move, and trees to speak;\nAugurs, and understood relations, have\nBy magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth\nThe secret\u2019st man of blood.\u2014What is the night?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nAlmost at odds with morning, which is which.\n\nMACBETH.\nHow say\u2019st thou, that Macduff denies his person\nAt our great bidding?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nDid you send to him, sir?\n\nMACBETH.\nI hear it by the way; but I will send.\nThere\u2019s not a one of them but in his house\nI keep a servant fee\u2019d. I will tomorrow\n(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters:\nMore shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,\nBy the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,\nAll causes shall give way: I am in blood\nStepp\u2019d in so far that, should I wade no more,\nReturning were as tedious as go o\u2019er.\nStrange things I have in head, that will to hand,\nWhich must be acted ere they may be scann\u2019d.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nYou lack the season of all natures, sleep.\n\nMACBETH.\nCome, we\u2019ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse\nIs the initiate fear that wants hard use.\nWe are yet but young in deed.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. The heath.\n\n Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate.\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nWhy, how now, Hecate? you look angerly.\n\nHECATE.\nHave I not reason, beldams as you are,\nSaucy and overbold? How did you dare\nTo trade and traffic with Macbeth\nIn riddles and affairs of death;\nAnd I, the mistress of your charms,\nThe close contriver of all harms,\nWas never call\u2019d to bear my part,\nOr show the glory of our art?\nAnd, which is worse, all you have done\nHath been but for a wayward son,\nSpiteful and wrathful; who, as others do,\nLoves for his own ends, not for you.\nBut make amends now: get you gone,\nAnd at the pit of Acheron\nMeet me i\u2019 th\u2019 morning: thither he\nWill come to know his destiny.\nYour vessels and your spells provide,\nYour charms, and everything beside.\nI am for th\u2019 air; this night I\u2019ll spend\nUnto a dismal and a fatal end.\nGreat business must be wrought ere noon.\nUpon the corner of the moon\nThere hangs a vap\u2019rous drop profound;\nI\u2019ll catch it ere it come to ground:\nAnd that, distill\u2019d by magic sleights,\nShall raise such artificial sprites,\nAs, by the strength of their illusion,\nShall draw him on to his confusion.\nHe shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear\nHis hopes \u2019bove wisdom, grace, and fear.\nAnd you all know, security\nIs mortals\u2019 chiefest enemy.\n\n [_Music and song within, \u201cCome away, come away\u201d &c._]\n\nHark! I am call\u2019d; my little spirit, see,\nSits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nCome, let\u2019s make haste; she\u2019ll soon be back again.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. Forres. A Room in the Palace.\n\n Enter Lennox and another Lord.\n\nLENNOX.\nMy former speeches have but hit your thoughts,\nWhich can interpret farther: only, I say,\nThing\u2019s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\nWas pitied of Macbeth:\u2014marry, he was dead:\u2014\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk\u2019d too late;\nWhom, you may say, if\u2019t please you, Fleance kill\u2019d,\nFor Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\nIt was for Malcolm and for Donalbain\nTo kill their gracious father? damned fact!\nHow it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents tear\nThat were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?\nWas not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;\nFor \u2019twould have anger\u2019d any heart alive,\nTo hear the men deny\u2019t. So that, I say,\nHe has borne all things well: and I do think,\nThat had he Duncan\u2019s sons under his key\n(As, and\u2019t please heaven, he shall not) they should find\nWhat \u2019twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.\nBut, peace!\u2014for from broad words, and \u2019cause he fail\u2019d\nHis presence at the tyrant\u2019s feast, I hear,\nMacduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\nWhere he bestows himself?\n\nLORD.\nThe son of Duncan,\nFrom whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,\nLives in the English court and is receiv\u2019d\nOf the most pious Edward with such grace\nThat the malevolence of fortune nothing\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduff\nIs gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward\nThat, by the help of these (with Him above\nTo ratify the work), we may again\nGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;\nFree from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\nDo faithful homage, and receive free honours,\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\nHath so exasperate the King that he\nPrepares for some attempt of war.\n\nLENNOX.\nSent he to Macduff?\n\nLORD.\nHe did: and with an absolute \u201cSir, not I,\u201d\nThe cloudy messenger turns me his back,\nAnd hums, as who should say, \u201cYou\u2019ll rue the time\nThat clogs me with this answer.\u201d\n\nLENNOX.\nAnd that well might\nAdvise him to a caution, t\u2019 hold what distance\nHis wisdom can provide. Some holy angel\nFly to the court of England, and unfold\nHis message ere he come, that a swift blessing\nMay soon return to this our suffering country\nUnder a hand accurs\u2019d!\n\nLORD.\nI\u2019ll send my prayers with him.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT IV.\n\nSCENE I.

Before the King\u2019s Palace.\n\n Enter Malcolm and Macduff.\n\nMALCOLM.\nLet us seek out some desolate shade and there\nWeep our sad bosoms empty.\n\nMACDUFF.\nLet us rather\nHold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,\nBestride our down-fall\u2019n birthdom. Each new morn\nNew widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows\nStrike heaven on the face, that it resounds\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell\u2019d out\nLike syllable of dolour.\n\nMALCOLM.\nWhat I believe, I\u2019ll wail;\nWhat know, believe; and what I can redress,\nAs I shall find the time to friend, I will.\nWhat you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.\nThis tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\nWas once thought honest: you have loved him well;\nHe hath not touch\u2019d you yet. I am young; but something\nYou may deserve of him through me; and wisdom\nTo offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb\nTo appease an angry god.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI am not treacherous.\n\nMALCOLM.\nBut Macbeth is.\nA good and virtuous nature may recoil\nIn an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell:\nThough all things foul would wear the brows of grace,\nYet grace must still look so.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI have lost my hopes.\n\nMALCOLM.\nPerchance even there where I did find my doubts.\nWhy in that rawness left you wife and child,\nThose precious motives, those strong knots of love,\nWithout leave-taking?\u2014I pray you,\nLet not my jealousies be your dishonours,\nBut mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,\nWhatever I shall think.\n\nMACDUFF.\nBleed, bleed, poor country!\nGreat tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,\nFor goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;\nThe title is affeer\u2019d.\u2014Fare thee well, lord:\nI would not be the villain that thou think\u2019st\nFor the whole space that\u2019s in the tyrant\u2019s grasp\nAnd the rich East to boot.\n\nMALCOLM.\nBe not offended:\nI speak not as in absolute fear of you.\nI think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\nIt weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash\nIs added to her wounds. I think, withal,\nThere would be hands uplifted in my right;\nAnd here, from gracious England, have I offer\nOf goodly thousands: but, for all this,\nWhen I shall tread upon the tyrant\u2019s head,\nOr wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\nShall have more vices than it had before,\nMore suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,\nBy him that shall succeed.\n\nMACDUFF.\nWhat should he be?\n\nMALCOLM.\nIt is myself I mean; in whom I know\nAll the particulars of vice so grafted\nThat, when they shall be open\u2019d, black Macbeth\nWill seem as pure as snow; and the poor state\nEsteem him as a lamb, being compar\u2019d\nWith my confineless harms.\n\nMACDUFF.\nNot in the legions\nOf horrid hell can come a devil more damn\u2019d\nIn evils to top Macbeth.\n\nMALCOLM.\nI grant him bloody,\nLuxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\nSudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\nThat has a name: but there\u2019s no bottom, none,\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill up\nThe cistern of my lust; and my desire\nAll continent impediments would o\u2019erbear,\nThat did oppose my will: better Macbeth\nThan such an one to reign.\n\nMACDUFF.\nBoundless intemperance\nIn nature is a tyranny; it hath been\nTh\u2019 untimely emptying of the happy throne,\nAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yet\nTo take upon you what is yours: you may\nConvey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\nAnd yet seem cold\u2014the time you may so hoodwink.\nWe have willing dames enough; there cannot be\nThat vulture in you, to devour so many\nAs will to greatness dedicate themselves,\nFinding it so inclin\u2019d.\n\nMALCOLM.\nWith this there grows\nIn my most ill-compos\u2019d affection such\nA staunchless avarice, that, were I king,\nI should cut off the nobles for their lands;\nDesire his jewels, and this other\u2019s house:\nAnd my more-having would be as a sauce\nTo make me hunger more; that I should forge\nQuarrels unjust against the good and loyal,\nDestroying them for wealth.\n\nMACDUFF.\nThis avarice\nSticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root\nThan summer-seeming lust; and it hath been\nThe sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;\nScotland hath foisons to fill up your will,\nOf your mere own. All these are portable,\nWith other graces weigh\u2019d.\n\nMALCOLM.\nBut I have none: the king-becoming graces,\nAs justice, verity, temp\u2019rance, stableness,\nBounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,\nDevotion, patience, courage, fortitude,\nI have no relish of them; but abound\nIn the division of each several crime,\nActing it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should\nPour the sweet milk of concord into hell,\nUproar the universal peace, confound\nAll unity on earth.\n\nMACDUFF.\nO Scotland, Scotland!\n\nMALCOLM.\nIf such a one be fit to govern, speak:\nI am as I have spoken.\n\nMACDUFF.\nFit to govern?\nNo, not to live.\u2014O nation miserable,\nWith an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter\u2019d,\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,\nSince that the truest issue of thy throne\nBy his own interdiction stands accus\u2019d,\nAnd does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father\nWas a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,\nOft\u2019ner upon her knees than on her feet,\nDied every day she lived. Fare thee well!\nThese evils thou repeat\u2019st upon thyself\nHave banish\u2019d me from Scotland.\u2014O my breast,\nThy hope ends here!\n\nMALCOLM.\nMacduff, this noble passion,\nChild of integrity, hath from my soul\nWiped the black scruples, reconcil\u2019d my thoughts\nTo thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth\nBy many of these trains hath sought to win me\nInto his power, and modest wisdom plucks me\nFrom over-credulous haste: but God above\nDeal between thee and me! for even now\nI put myself to thy direction, and\nUnspeak mine own detraction; here abjure\nThe taints and blames I laid upon myself,\nFor strangers to my nature. I am yet\nUnknown to woman; never was forsworn;\nScarcely have coveted what was mine own;\nAt no time broke my faith; would not betray\nThe devil to his fellow; and delight\nNo less in truth than life: my first false speaking\nWas this upon myself. What I am truly,\nIs thine and my poor country\u2019s to command:\nWhither, indeed, before thy here-approach,\nOld Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,\nAlready at a point, was setting forth.\nNow we\u2019ll together, and the chance of goodness\nBe like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?\n\nMACDUFF.\nSuch welcome and unwelcome things at once\n\u2019Tis hard to reconcile.\n\n Enter a Doctor.\n\nMALCOLM.\nWell; more anon.\u2014Comes the King forth, I pray you?\n\nDOCTOR.\nAy, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls\nThat stay his cure: their malady convinces\nThe great assay of art; but at his touch,\nSuch sanctity hath heaven given his hand,\nThey presently amend.\n\nMALCOLM.\nI thank you, doctor.\n\n [_Exit Doctor._]\n\nMACDUFF.\nWhat\u2019s the disease he means?\n\nMALCOLM.\n\u2019Tis call\u2019d the evil:\nA most miraculous work in this good king;\nWhich often, since my here-remain in England,\nI have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,\nHimself best knows, but strangely-visited people,\nAll swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,\nThe mere despair of surgery, he cures;\nHanging a golden stamp about their necks,\nPut on with holy prayers: and \u2019tis spoken,\nTo the succeeding royalty he leaves\nThe healing benediction. With this strange virtue,\nHe hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;\nAnd sundry blessings hang about his throne,\nThat speak him full of grace.\n\n Enter Ross.\n\nMACDUFF.\nSee, who comes here?\n\nMALCOLM.\nMy countryman; but yet I know him not.\n\nMACDUFF.\nMy ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.\n\nMALCOLM.\nI know him now. Good God, betimes remove\nThe means that makes us strangers!\n\nROSS.\nSir, amen.\n\nMACDUFF.\nStands Scotland where it did?\n\nROSS.\nAlas, poor country,\nAlmost afraid to know itself! It cannot\nBe call\u2019d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,\nBut who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\nWhere sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,\nAre made, not mark\u2019d; where violent sorrow seems\nA modern ecstasy. The dead man\u2019s knell\nIs there scarce ask\u2019d for who; and good men\u2019s lives\nExpire before the flowers in their caps,\nDying or ere they sicken.\n\nMACDUFF.\nO, relation\nToo nice, and yet too true!\n\nMALCOLM.\nWhat\u2019s the newest grief?\n\nROSS.\nThat of an hour\u2019s age doth hiss the speaker;\nEach minute teems a new one.\n\nMACDUFF.\nHow does my wife?\n\nROSS.\nWhy, well.\n\nMACDUFF.\nAnd all my children?\n\nROSS.\nWell too.\n\nMACDUFF.\nThe tyrant has not batter\u2019d at their peace?\n\nROSS.\nNo; they were well at peace when I did leave \u2019em.\n\nMACDUFF.\nBe not a niggard of your speech: how goes\u2019t?\n\nROSS.\nWhen I came hither to transport the tidings,\nWhich I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour\nOf many worthy fellows that were out;\nWhich was to my belief witness\u2019d the rather,\nFor that I saw the tyrant\u2019s power afoot.\nNow is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland\nWould create soldiers, make our women fight,\nTo doff their dire distresses.\n\nMALCOLM.\nBe\u2019t their comfort\nWe are coming thither. Gracious England hath\nLent us good Siward and ten thousand men;\nAn older and a better soldier none\nThat Christendom gives out.\n\nROSS.\nWould I could answer\nThis comfort with the like! But I have words\nThat would be howl\u2019d out in the desert air,\nWhere hearing should not latch them.\n\nMACDUFF.\nWhat concern they?\nThe general cause? or is it a fee-grief\nDue to some single breast?\n\nROSS.\nNo mind that\u2019s honest\nBut in it shares some woe, though the main part\nPertains to you alone.\n\nMACDUFF.\nIf it be mine,\nKeep it not from me, quickly let me have it.\n\nROSS.\nLet not your ears despise my tongue for ever,\nWhich shall possess them with the heaviest sound\nThat ever yet they heard.\n\nMACDUFF.\nHumh! I guess at it.\n\nROSS.\nYour castle is surpris\u2019d; your wife and babes\nSavagely slaughter\u2019d. To relate the manner\nWere, on the quarry of these murder\u2019d deer,\nTo add the death of you.\n\nMALCOLM.\nMerciful heaven!\u2014\nWhat, man! ne\u2019er pull your hat upon your brows.\nGive sorrow words. The grief that does not speak\nWhispers the o\u2019er-fraught heart, and bids it break.\n\nMACDUFF.\nMy children too?\n\nROSS.\nWife, children, servants, all\nThat could be found.\n\nMACDUFF.\nAnd I must be from thence!\nMy wife kill\u2019d too?\n\nROSS.\nI have said.\n\nMALCOLM.\nBe comforted:\nLet\u2019s make us med\u2019cines of our great revenge,\nTo cure this deadly grief.\n\nMACDUFF.\nHe has no children.\u2014All my pretty ones?\nDid you say all?\u2014O hell-kite!\u2014All?\nWhat, all my pretty chickens and their dam\nAt one fell swoop?\n\nMALCOLM.\nDispute it like a man.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI shall do so;\nBut I must also feel it as a man:\nI cannot but remember such things were,\nThat were most precious to me.\u2014Did heaven look on,\nAnd would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,\nThey were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,\nNot for their own demerits, but for mine,\nFell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!\n\nMALCOLM.\nBe this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief\nConvert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\n\nMACDUFF.\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes,\nAnd braggart with my tongue!\u2014But, gentle heavens,\nCut short all intermission; front to front,\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\nWithin my sword\u2019s length set him; if he \u2019scape,\nHeaven forgive him too!\n\nMALCOLM.\nThis tune goes manly.\nCome, go we to the King. Our power is ready;\nOur lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth\nIs ripe for shaking, and the powers above\nPut on their instruments.

When was it she last walked?\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nSince his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her\nbed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,\nfold it, write upon\u2019t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to\nbed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.\n\nDOCTOR.\nA great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of\nsleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation,\nbesides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time,\nhave you heard her say?\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nThat, sir, which I will not report after her.\n\nDOCTOR.\nYou may to me; and \u2019tis most meet you should.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nNeither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.\n\n Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.\n\nLo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast\nasleep. Observe her; stand close.\n\nDOCTOR.\nHow came she by that light?\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nWhy, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; \u2019tis her\ncommand.\n\nDOCTOR.\nYou see, her eyes are open.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nAy, but their sense are shut.\n\nDOCTOR.\nWhat is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nIt is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I\nhave known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nYet here\u2019s a spot.\n\nDOCTOR.\nHark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my\nremembrance the more strongly.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nOut, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then \u2019tis time to do\u2019t.\nHell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we\nfear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who\nwould have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?\n\nDOCTOR.\nDo you mark that?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nThe Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?\u2014What, will these hands\nne\u2019er be clean? No more o\u2019 that, my lord, no more o\u2019 that: you mar all\nwith this starting.\n\nDOCTOR.\nGo to, go to. You have known what you should not.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nShe has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what\nshe has known.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nHere\u2019s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will\nnot sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!\n\nDOCTOR.\nWhat a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nI would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole\nbody.\n\nDOCTOR.\nWell, well, well.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nPray God it be, sir.\n\nDOCTOR.\nThis disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have\nwalked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you\nyet again, Banquo\u2019s buried; he cannot come out on\u2019s grave.\n\nDOCTOR.\nEven so?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nTo bed, to bed. There\u2019s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come,\ngive me your hand. What\u2019s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to\nbed.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nDOCTOR.\nWill she go now to bed?\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nDirectly.\n\nDOCTOR.\nFoul whisp\u2019rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds\nDo breed unnatural troubles: infected minds\nTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.\nMore needs she the divine than the physician.\u2014\nGod, God, forgive us all! Look after her;\nRemove from her the means of all annoyance,\nAnd still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:\nMy mind she has mated, and amaz\u2019d my sight.\nI think, but dare not speak.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nGood night, good doctor.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. The Country near Dunsinane.\n\n Enter, with drum and colours Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox and\n Soldiers.\n\nMENTEITH.\nThe English power is near, led on by Malcolm,\nHis uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.\nRevenges burn in them; for their dear causes\nWould to the bleeding and the grim alarm\nExcite the mortified man.\n\nANGUS.\nNear Birnam wood\nShall we well meet them. That way are they coming.\n\nCAITHNESS.\nWho knows if Donalbain be with his brother?\n\nLENNOX.\nFor certain, sir, he is not. I have a file\nOf all the gentry: there is Siward\u2019s son\nAnd many unrough youths, that even now\nProtest their first of manhood.\n\nMENTEITH.\nWhat does the tyrant?\n\nCAITHNESS.\nGreat Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.\nSome say he\u2019s mad; others, that lesser hate him,\nDo call it valiant fury: but, for certain,\nHe cannot buckle his distemper\u2019d cause\nWithin the belt of rule.\n\nANGUS.\nNow does he feel\nHis secret murders sticking on his hands;\nNow minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;\nThose he commands move only in command,\nNothing in love: now does he feel his title\nHang loose about him, like a giant\u2019s robe\nUpon a dwarfish thief.\n\nMENTEITH.\nWho, then, shall blame\nHis pester\u2019d senses to recoil and start,\nWhen all that is within him does condemn\nItself for being there?\n\nCAITHNESS.\nWell, march we on,\nTo give obedience where \u2019tis truly ow\u2019d:\nMeet we the med\u2019cine of the sickly weal;\nAnd with him pour we, in our country\u2019s purge,\nEach drop of us.\n\nLENNOX.\nOr so much as it needs\nTo dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds.\nMake we our march towards Birnam.\n\n [_Exeunt, marching._]\n\nSCENE III. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.\n\n Enter Macbeth, Doctor and Attendants.\n\nMACBETH.\nBring me no more reports; let them fly all:\nTill Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane\nI cannot taint with fear. What\u2019s the boy Malcolm?\nWas he not born of woman? The spirits that know\nAll mortal consequences have pronounc\u2019d me thus:\n\u201cFear not, Macbeth; no man that\u2019s born of woman\nShall e\u2019er have power upon thee.\u201d\u2014Then fly, false thanes,\nAnd mingle with the English epicures:\nThe mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,\nShall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.\n\n Enter a Servant.\n\nThe devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac\u2019d loon!\nWhere gott\u2019st thou that goose look?\n\nSERVANT.\nThere is ten thousand\u2014\n\nMACBETH.\nGeese, villain?\n\nSERVANT.\nSoldiers, sir.\n\nMACBETH.\nGo prick thy face and over-red thy fear,\nThou lily-liver\u2019d boy. What soldiers, patch?\nDeath of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine\nAre counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?\n\nSERVANT.\nThe English force, so please you.\n\nMACBETH.\nTake thy face hence.\n\n [_Exit Servant._]\n\nSeyton!\u2014I am sick at heart,\nWhen I behold\u2014Seyton, I say!\u2014This push\nWill cheer me ever or disseat me now.\nI have liv\u2019d long enough: my way of life\nIs fall\u2019n into the sere, the yellow leaf;\nAnd that which should accompany old age,\nAs honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,\nI must not look to have; but, in their stead,\nCurses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,\nWhich the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.\nSeyton!\u2014\n\n Enter Seyton.\n\nSEYTON.\nWhat\u2019s your gracious pleasure?\n\nMACBETH.\nWhat news more?\n\nSEYTON.\nAll is confirm\u2019d, my lord, which was reported.\n\nMACBETH.\nI\u2019ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack\u2019d.\nGive me my armour.\n\nSEYTON.\n\u2019Tis not needed yet.\n\nMACBETH.\nI\u2019ll put it on.\nSend out more horses, skirr the country round;\nHang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.\u2014\nHow does your patient, doctor?\n\nDOCTOR.\nNot so sick, my lord,\nAs she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,\nThat keep her from her rest.\n\nMACBETH.\nCure her of that:\nCanst thou not minister to a mind diseas\u2019d,\nPluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,\nRaze out the written troubles of the brain,\nAnd with some sweet oblivious antidote\nCleanse the stuff\u2019d bosom of that perilous stuff\nWhich weighs upon the heart?\n\nDOCTOR.\nTherein the patient\nMust minister to himself.\n\nMACBETH.\nThrow physic to the dogs, I\u2019ll none of it.\nCome, put mine armour on; give me my staff:\nSeyton, send out.\u2014Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.\u2014\nCome, sir, despatch.\u2014If thou couldst, doctor, cast\nThe water of my land, find her disease,\nAnd purge it to a sound and pristine health,\nI would applaud thee to the very echo,\nThat should applaud again.\u2014Pull\u2019t off, I say.\u2014\nWhat rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,\nWould scour these English hence? Hear\u2019st thou of them?\n\nDOCTOR.\nAy, my good lord. Your royal preparation\nMakes us hear something.\n\nMACBETH.\nBring it after me.\u2014\nI will not be afraid of death and bane,\nTill Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.\n\n [_Exeunt all except Doctor._]\n\nDOCTOR.\nWere I from Dunsinane away and clear,\nProfit again should hardly draw me here.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE IV. Country near Dunsinane: a Wood in view.\n\n Enter, with drum and colours Malcolm, old Siward and his Son, Macduff,\n Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross and Soldiers, marching.\n\nMALCOLM.\nCousins, I hope the days are near at hand\nThat chambers will be safe.\n\nMENTEITH.\nWe doubt it nothing.\n\nSIWARD.\nWhat wood is this before us?\n\nMENTEITH.\nThe wood of Birnam.\n\nMALCOLM.\nLet every soldier hew him down a bough,\nAnd bear\u2019t before him. Thereby shall we shadow\nThe numbers of our host, and make discovery\nErr in report of us.\n\nSOLDIERS.\nIt shall be done.\n\nSIWARD.\nWe learn no other but the confident tyrant\nKeeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure\nOur setting down before\u2019t.\n\nMALCOLM.\n\u2019Tis his main hope;\nFor where there is advantage to be given,\nBoth more and less have given him the revolt,\nAnd none serve with him but constrained things,\nWhose hearts are absent too.\n\nMACDUFF.\nLet our just censures\nAttend the true event, and put we on\nIndustrious soldiership.\n\nSIWARD.\nThe time approaches,\nThat will with due decision make us know\nWhat we shall say we have, and what we owe.\nThoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,\nBut certain issue strokes must arbitrate;\nTowards which advance the war.\n\n [_Exeunt, marching._]\n\nSCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.\n\n Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton and Soldiers.\n\nMACBETH.\nHang out our banners on the outward walls;\nThe cry is still, \u201cThey come!\u201d Our castle\u2019s strength\nWill laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie\nTill famine and the ague eat them up.\nWere they not forc\u2019d with those that should be ours,\nWe might have met them dareful, beard to beard,\nAnd beat them backward home.\n\n [_A cry of women within._]\n\nWhat is that noise?\n\nSEYTON.\nIt is the cry of women, my good lord.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nMACBETH.\nI have almost forgot the taste of fears.\nThe time has been, my senses would have cool\u2019d\nTo hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair\nWould at a dismal treatise rouse and stir\nAs life were in\u2019t. I have supp\u2019d full with horrors;\nDireness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,\nCannot once start me.\n\n Enter Seyton.\n\nWherefore was that cry?\n\nSEYTON.\nThe Queen, my lord, is dead.\n\nMACBETH.\nShe should have died hereafter.\nThere would have been a time for such a word.\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day,\nTo the last syllable of recorded time;\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\nLife\u2019s but a walking shadow; a poor player,\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\nSignifying nothing.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nThou com\u2019st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.\n\nMESSENGER.\nGracious my lord,\nI should report that which I say I saw,\nBut know not how to do\u2019t.\n\nMACBETH.\nWell, say, sir.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAs I did stand my watch upon the hill,\nI look\u2019d toward Birnam, and anon, methought,\nThe wood began to move.\n\nMACBETH.\nLiar, and slave!\n\nMESSENGER.\nLet me endure your wrath, if\u2019t be not so.\nWithin this three mile may you see it coming;\nI say, a moving grove.\n\nMACBETH.\nIf thou speak\u2019st false,\nUpon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,\nTill famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,\nI care not if thou dost for me as much.\u2014\nI pull in resolution; and begin\nTo doubt th\u2019 equivocation of the fiend,\nThat lies like truth. \u201cFear not, till Birnam wood\nDo come to Dunsinane;\u201d and now a wood\nComes toward Dunsinane.\u2014Arm, arm, and out!\u2014\nIf this which he avouches does appear,\nThere is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.\nI \u2019gin to be aweary of the sun,\nAnd wish th\u2019 estate o\u2019 th\u2019 world were now undone.\u2014\nRing the alarum bell!\u2014Blow, wind! come, wrack!\nAt least we\u2019ll die with harness on our back.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. The same. A Plain before the Castle.\n\n Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff and their\n Army, with boughs.\n\nMALCOLM.\nNow near enough. Your leafy screens throw down,\nAnd show like those you are.\u2014You, worthy uncle,\nShall with my cousin, your right noble son,\nLead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we\nShall take upon\u2019s what else remains to do,\nAccording to our order.\n\nSIWARD.\nFare you well.\u2014\nDo we but find the tyrant\u2019s power tonight,\nLet us be beaten, if we cannot fight.\n\nMACDUFF.\nMake all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,\nThose clamorous harbingers of blood and death.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VII. The same. Another part of the Plain.\n\n Alarums. Enter Macbeth.\n\nMACBETH.\nThey have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,\nBut, bear-like I must fight the course.\u2014What\u2019s he\nThat was not born of woman? Such a one\nAm I to fear, or none.\n\n Enter young Siward.\n\nYOUNG SIWARD.\nWhat is thy name?\n\nMACBETH.\nThou\u2019lt be afraid to hear it.\n\nYOUNG SIWARD.\nNo; though thou call\u2019st thyself a hotter name\nThan any is in hell.\n\nMACBETH.\nMy name\u2019s Macbeth.\n\nYOUNG SIWARD.\nThe devil himself could not pronounce a title\nMore hateful to mine ear.\n\nMACBETH.\nNo, nor more fearful.\n\nYOUNG SIWARD.\nThou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword\nI\u2019ll prove the lie thou speak\u2019st.\n\n [_They fight, and young Siward is slain._]\n\nMACBETH.\nThou wast born of woman.\nBut swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,\nBrandish\u2019d by man that\u2019s of a woman born.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n Alarums. Enter Macduff.\n\nMACDUFF.\nThat way the noise is.\u2014Tyrant, show thy face!\nIf thou be\u2019st slain and with no stroke of mine,\nMy wife and children\u2019s ghosts will haunt me still.\nI cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms\nAre hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,\nOr else my sword, with an unbatter\u2019d edge,\nI sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;\nBy this great clatter, one of greatest note\nSeems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!\nAnd more I beg not.\n\n [_Exit. Alarums._]\n\n Enter Malcolm and old Siward.\n\nSIWARD.\nThis way, my lord;\u2014the castle\u2019s gently render\u2019d:\nThe tyrant\u2019s people on both sides do fight;\nThe noble thanes do bravely in the war,\nThe day almost itself professes yours,\nAnd little is to do.\n\nMALCOLM.\nWe have met with foes\nThat strike beside us.\n\nSIWARD.\nEnter, sir, the castle.\n\n [_Exeunt. Alarums._]\n\nSCENE VIII. The same. Another part of the field.\n\n Enter Macbeth.\n\nMACBETH.\nWhy should I play the Roman fool, and die\nOn mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes\nDo better upon them.\n\n Enter Macduff.\n\nMACDUFF.\nTurn, hell-hound, turn!\n\nMACBETH.\nOf all men else I have avoided thee:\nBut get thee back; my soul is too much charg\u2019d\nWith blood of thine already.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI have no words;\nMy voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain\nThan terms can give thee out!\n\n [_They fight._]\n\nMACBETH.\nThou losest labour:\nAs easy mayst thou the intrenchant air\nWith thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed:\nLet fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;\nI bear a charmed life, which must not yield\nTo one of woman born.\n\nMACDUFF.\nDespair thy charm;\nAnd let the angel whom thou still hast serv\u2019d\nTell thee, Macduff was from his mother\u2019s womb\nUntimely ripp\u2019d.\n\nMACBETH.\nAccursed be that tongue that tells me so,\nFor it hath cow\u2019d my better part of man!\nAnd be these juggling fiends no more believ\u2019d,\nThat palter with us in a double sense;\nThat keep the word of promise to our ear,\nAnd break it to our hope!\u2014I\u2019ll not fight with thee.\n\nMACDUFF.\nThen yield thee, coward,\nAnd live to be the show and gaze o\u2019 th\u2019 time.\nWe\u2019ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,\nPainted upon a pole, and underwrit,\n\u201cHere may you see the tyrant.\u201d\n\nMACBETH.\nI will not yield,\nTo kiss the ground before young Malcolm\u2019s feet,\nAnd to be baited with the rabble\u2019s curse.\nThough Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,\nAnd thou oppos\u2019d, being of no woman born,\nYet I will try the last. Before my body\nI throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff;\nAnd damn\u2019d be him that first cries, \u201cHold, enough!\u201d\n\n [_Exeunt fighting. Alarums._]\n\n Retreat. Flourish.

Your cause of sorrow\nMust not be measur\u2019d by his worth, for then\nIt hath no end.\n\nSIWARD.\nHad he his hurts before?\n\nROSS.\nAy, on the front.\n\nSIWARD.\nWhy then, God\u2019s soldier be he!\nHad I as many sons as I have hairs,\nI would not wish them to a fairer death:\nAnd so his knell is knoll\u2019d.\n\nMALCOLM.\nHe\u2019s worth more sorrow,\nAnd that I\u2019ll spend for him.\n\nSIWARD.\nHe\u2019s worth no more.\nThey say he parted well and paid his score:\nAnd so, God be with him!\u2014Here comes newer comfort.\n\n Enter Macduff with Macbeth\u2019s head.\n\nMACDUFF.\nHail, King, for so thou art. Behold, where stands\nTh\u2019 usurper\u2019s cursed head: the time is free.\nI see thee compass\u2019d with thy kingdom\u2019s pearl,\nThat speak my salutation in their minds;\nWhose voices I desire aloud with mine,\u2014\nHail, King of Scotland!\n\nALL.\nHail, King of Scotland!\n\n [_Flourish._]\n\nMALCOLM.\nWe shall not spend a large expense of time\nBefore we reckon with your several loves,\nAnd make us even with you.
