On a ship at sea; a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning\nheard.\n\n Enter a Shipmaster and a Boatswain severally.\n\nMASTER.\nBoatswain!\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nHere, master: what cheer?\n\nMASTER.\nGood! Speak to the mariners: fall to \u2019t yarely, or we run ourselves\naground: bestir, bestir.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n Enter Mariners.\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nHeigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare! Take in the\ntopsail. Tend to th\u2019 master\u2019s whistle. Blow till thou burst thy wind,\nif room enough.\n\n Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Ferdinand, Gonzalo and others.\n\nALONSO.\nGood boatswain, have care. Where\u2019s the master?\nPlay the men.\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nI pray now, keep below.\n\nANTONIO.\nWhere is the master, boson?\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nDo you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you do\nassist the storm.\n\nGONZALO.\nNay, good, be patient.\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nWhen the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king?\nTo cabin! silence! Trouble us not.\n\nGONZALO.\nGood, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nNone that I more love than myself. You are a counsellor: if you can\ncommand these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present,\nwe will not hand a rope more. Use your authority: if you cannot, give\nthanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin\nfor the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.\u2014Cheerly, good hearts!\u2014Out\nof our way, I say.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nGONZALO.\nI have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning\nmark upon him. His complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good\nFate, to his hanging! Make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our\nown doth little advantage! If he be not born to be hang\u2019d, our case is\nmiserable.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n Re-enter Boatswain.\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nDown with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try wi\u2019 th\u2019\nmaincourse.\n\n [_A cry within._]\n\n A plague upon this howling! They are louder than the weather or our\n office.\n\n Enter Sebastian, Antonio and Gonzalo.\n\nYet again! What do you here? Shall we give o\u2019er, and drown? Have you a\nmind to sink?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nA pox o\u2019 your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nWork you, then.\n\nANTONIO.\nHang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid\nto be drowned than thou art.\n\nGONZALO.\nI\u2019ll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were no stronger than a\nnutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched wench.\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nLay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses: off to sea again: lay her\noff.\n\n Enter Mariners, wet.\n\nMARINERS.\nAll lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nWhat, must our mouths be cold?\n\nGONZALO.\nThe King and Prince at prayers! Let\u2019s assist them,\nFor our case is as theirs.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI am out of patience.\n\nANTONIO.\nWe are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.\nThis wide-chapp\u2019d rascal\u2014would thou might\u2019st lie drowning\nThe washing of ten tides!\n\nGONZALO.\nHe\u2019ll be hang\u2019d yet,\nThough every drop of water swear against it,\nAnd gape at wid\u2019st to glut him.\n\n_A confused noise within: _\u201cMercy on us!\u201d\u2014\n\u201cWe split, we split!\u201d\u2014\u201cFarewell, my wife and children!\u201d\u2014\n\u201cFarewell, brother!\u201d\u2014\u201cWe split, we split, we split!\u201d\n\nANTONIO.\nLet\u2019s all sink wi\u2019 th\u2019 King.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nLet\u2019s take leave of him.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nGONZALO.\nNow would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren\nground. Long heath, brown furze, anything. The wills above be done! but\nI would fain die a dry death.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II. The Island. Before the cell of Prospero.\n\n Enter Prospero and Miranda.\n\nMIRANDA.\nIf by your art, my dearest father, you have\nPut the wild waters in this roar, allay them.\nThe sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,\nBut that the sea, mounting to th\u2019 welkin\u2019s cheek,\nDashes the fire out. O! I have suffered\nWith those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,\nWho had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,\nDash\u2019d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock\nAgainst my very heart. Poor souls, they perish\u2019d.\nHad I been any god of power, I would\nHave sunk the sea within the earth, or ere\nIt should the good ship so have swallow\u2019d and\nThe fraughting souls within her.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBe collected:\nNo more amazement: tell your piteous heart\nThere\u2019s no harm done.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO, woe the day!\n\nPROSPERO.\nNo harm.\nI have done nothing but in care of thee,\nOf thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who\nArt ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing\nOf whence I am, nor that I am more better\nThan Prospero, master of a full poor cell,\nAnd thy no greater father.\n\nMIRANDA.\nMore to know\nDid never meddle with my thoughts.\n\nPROSPERO.\n\u2019Tis time\nI should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,\nAnd pluck my magic garment from me.\u2014So:\n\n [_Lays down his mantle._]\n\nLie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.\nThe direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch\u2019d\nThe very virtue of compassion in thee,\nI have with such provision in mine art\nSo safely ordered that there is no soul\u2014\nNo, not so much perdition as an hair\nBetid to any creature in the vessel\nWhich thou heard\u2019st cry, which thou saw\u2019st sink. Sit down;\nFor thou must now know farther.\n\nMIRANDA.\nYou have often\nBegun to tell me what I am, but stopp\u2019d,\nAnd left me to a bootless inquisition,\nConcluding \u201cStay; not yet.\u201d\n\nPROSPERO.\nThe hour\u2019s now come,\nThe very minute bids thee ope thine ear;\nObey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember\nA time before we came unto this cell?\nI do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not\nOut three years old.\n\nMIRANDA.\nCertainly, sir, I can.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBy what? By any other house, or person?\nOf anything the image, tell me, that\nHath kept with thy remembrance.\n\nMIRANDA.\n\u2019Tis far off,\nAnd rather like a dream than an assurance\nThat my remembrance warrants. Had I not\nFour or five women once that tended me?\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it\nThat this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else\nIn the dark backward and abysm of time?\nIf thou rememb\u2019rest aught ere thou cam\u2019st here,\nHow thou cam\u2019st here, thou mayst.\n\nMIRANDA.\nBut that I do not.\n\nPROSPERO.\nTwelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,\nThy father was the Duke of Milan, and\nA prince of power.\n\nMIRANDA.\nSir, are not you my father?\n\nPROSPERO.\nThy mother was a piece of virtue, and\nShe said thou wast my daughter. And thy father\nWas Duke of Milan, and his only heir\nAnd princess, no worse issued.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO, the heavens!\nWhat foul play had we that we came from thence?\nOr blessed was\u2019t we did?\n\nPROSPERO.\nBoth, both, my girl.\nBy foul play, as thou say\u2019st, were we heav\u2019d thence;\nBut blessedly holp hither.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO, my heart bleeds\nTo think o\u2019 th\u2019 teen that I have turn\u2019d you to,\nWhich is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.\n\nPROSPERO.\nMy brother and thy uncle, call\u2019d Antonio\u2014\nI pray thee, mark me, that a brother should\nBe so perfidious!\u2014he whom next thyself\nOf all the world I lov\u2019d, and to him put\nThe manage of my state; as at that time\nThrough all the signories it was the first,\nAnd Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed\nIn dignity, and for the liberal arts,\nWithout a parallel: those being all my study,\nThe government I cast upon my brother,\nAnd to my state grew stranger, being transported\nAnd rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle\u2014\nDost thou attend me?\n\nMIRANDA.\nSir, most heedfully.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBeing once perfected how to grant suits,\nHow to deny them, who t\u2019 advance, and who\nTo trash for over-topping, new created\nThe creatures that were mine, I say, or chang\u2019d \u2019em,\nOr else new form\u2019d \u2019em: having both the key\nOf officer and office, set all hearts i\u2019 th\u2019 state\nTo what tune pleas\u2019d his ear: that now he was\nThe ivy which had hid my princely trunk,\nAnd suck\u2019d my verdure out on \u2019t. Thou attend\u2019st not.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO, good sir! I do.\n\nPROSPERO.\nI pray thee, mark me.\nI, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated\nTo closeness and the bettering of my mind\nWith that which, but by being so retir\u2019d,\nO\u2019er-priz\u2019d all popular rate, in my false brother\nAwak\u2019d an evil nature; and my trust,\nLike a good parent, did beget of him\nA falsehood in its contrary as great\nAs my trust was; which had indeed no limit,\nA confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,\nNot only with what my revenue yielded,\nBut what my power might else exact, like one\nWho having into truth, by telling of it,\nMade such a sinner of his memory,\nTo credit his own lie, he did believe\nHe was indeed the Duke; out o\u2019 the substitution,\nAnd executing th\u2019 outward face of royalty,\nWith all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing\u2014\nDost thou hear?\n\nMIRANDA.\nYour tale, sir, would cure deafness.\n\nPROSPERO.\nTo have no screen between this part he play\u2019d\nAnd him he play\u2019d it for, he needs will be\nAbsolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library\nWas dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties\nHe thinks me now incapable; confederates,\nSo dry he was for sway, wi\u2019 th\u2019 King of Naples\nTo give him annual tribute, do him homage,\nSubject his coronet to his crown, and bend\nThe dukedom, yet unbow\u2019d\u2014alas, poor Milan!\u2014\nTo most ignoble stooping.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO the heavens!\n\nPROSPERO.\nMark his condition, and the event; then tell me\nIf this might be a brother.\n\nMIRANDA.\nI should sin\nTo think but nobly of my grandmother:\nGood wombs have borne bad sons.\n\nPROSPERO.\nNow the condition.\nThis King of Naples, being an enemy\nTo me inveterate, hearkens my brother\u2019s suit;\nWhich was, that he, in lieu o\u2019 th\u2019 premises\nOf homage and I know not how much tribute,\nShould presently extirpate me and mine\nOut of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,\nWith all the honours on my brother: whereon,\nA treacherous army levied, one midnight\nFated to th\u2019 purpose, did Antonio open\nThe gates of Milan; and, i\u2019 th\u2019 dead of darkness,\nThe ministers for th\u2019 purpose hurried thence\nMe and thy crying self.\n\nMIRANDA.\nAlack, for pity!\nI, not rememb\u2019ring how I cried out then,\nWill cry it o\u2019er again: it is a hint\nThat wrings mine eyes to \u2019t.\n\nPROSPERO.\nHear a little further,\nAnd then I\u2019ll bring thee to the present business\nWhich now\u2019s upon us; without the which this story\nWere most impertinent.\n\nMIRANDA.\nWherefore did they not\nThat hour destroy us?\n\nPROSPERO.\nWell demanded, wench:\nMy tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,\nSo dear the love my people bore me, nor set\nA mark so bloody on the business; but\nWith colours fairer painted their foul ends.\nIn few, they hurried us aboard a bark,\nBore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared\nA rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg\u2019d,\nNor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats\nInstinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,\nTo cry to th\u2019 sea, that roar\u2019d to us; to sigh\nTo th\u2019 winds, whose pity, sighing back again,\nDid us but loving wrong.\n\nMIRANDA.\nAlack, what trouble\nWas I then to you!\n\nPROSPERO.\nO, a cherubin\nThou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,\nInfused with a fortitude from heaven,\nWhen I have deck\u2019d the sea with drops full salt,\nUnder my burden groan\u2019d: which rais\u2019d in me\nAn undergoing stomach, to bear up\nAgainst what should ensue.\n\nMIRANDA.\nHow came we ashore?\n\nPROSPERO.\nBy Providence divine.\nSome food we had and some fresh water that\nA noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,\nOut of his charity, who being then appointed\nMaster of this design, did give us, with\nRich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,\nWhich since have steaded much: so, of his gentleness,\nKnowing I lov\u2019d my books, he furnish\u2019d me\nFrom mine own library with volumes that\nI prize above my dukedom.\n\nMIRANDA.\nWould I might\nBut ever see that man!\n\nPROSPERO.\nNow I arise.\nSit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.\nHere in this island we arriv\u2019d; and here\nHave I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit\nThan other princes can, that have more time\nFor vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.\n\nMIRANDA.\nHeavens thank you for \u2019t! And now, I pray you, sir,\nFor still \u2019tis beating in my mind, your reason\nFor raising this sea-storm?\n\nPROSPERO.\nKnow thus far forth.\nBy accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,\nNow my dear lady, hath mine enemies\nBrought to this shore; and by my prescience\nI find my zenith doth depend upon\nA most auspicious star, whose influence\nIf now I court not but omit, my fortunes\nWill ever after droop. Here cease more questions;\nThou art inclin\u2019d to sleep; \u2019tis a good dulness,\nAnd give it way. I know thou canst not choose.\n\n [_Miranda sleeps._]\n\nCome away, servant, come! I am ready now.\nApproach, my Ariel. Come!\n\n Enter Ariel.\n\nARIEL.\nAll hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come\nTo answer thy best pleasure; be\u2019t to fly,\nTo swim, to dive into the fire, to ride\nOn the curl\u2019d clouds, to thy strong bidding task\nAriel and all his quality.\n\nPROSPERO.\nHast thou, spirit,\nPerform\u2019d to point the tempest that I bade thee?\n\nARIEL.\nTo every article.\nI boarded the King\u2019s ship; now on the beak,\nNow in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\nI flam\u2019d amazement; sometime I\u2019d divide,\nAnd burn in many places; on the topmast,\nThe yards, and boresprit, would I flame distinctly,\nThen meet and join. Jove\u2019s lightning, the precursors\nO\u2019 th\u2019 dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary\nAnd sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks\nOf sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune\nSeem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,\nYea, his dread trident shake.\n\nPROSPERO.\nMy brave spirit!\nWho was so firm, so constant, that this coil\nWould not infect his reason?\n\nARIEL.\nNot a soul\nBut felt a fever of the mad, and play\u2019d\nSome tricks of desperation. All but mariners\nPlunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,\nThen all afire with me: the King\u2019s son, Ferdinand,\nWith hair up-staring\u2014then like reeds, not hair\u2014\nWas the first man that leapt; cried \u201cHell is empty,\nAnd all the devils are here.\u201d\n\nPROSPERO.\nWhy, that\u2019s my spirit!\nBut was not this nigh shore?\n\nARIEL.\nClose by, my master.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBut are they, Ariel, safe?\n\nARIEL.\nNot a hair perish\u2019d;\nOn their sustaining garments not a blemish,\nBut fresher than before: and, as thou bad\u2019st me,\nIn troops I have dispers\u2019d them \u2019bout the isle.\nThe King\u2019s son have I landed by himself,\nWhom I left cooling of the air with sighs\nIn an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,\nHis arms in this sad knot.\n\nPROSPERO.\nOf the King\u2019s ship\nThe mariners, say how thou hast dispos\u2019d,\nAnd all the rest o\u2019 th\u2019 fleet?\n\nARIEL.\nSafely in harbour\nIs the King\u2019s ship; in the deep nook, where once\nThou call\u2019dst me up at midnight to fetch dew\nFrom the still-vex\u2019d Bermoothes; there she\u2019s hid:\nThe mariners all under hatches stowed;\nWho, with a charm join\u2019d to their suff\u2019red labour,\nI have left asleep: and for the rest o\u2019 th\u2019 fleet,\nWhich I dispers\u2019d, they all have met again,\nAnd are upon the Mediterranean flote\nBound sadly home for Naples,\nSupposing that they saw the King\u2019s ship wrack\u2019d,\nAnd his great person perish.\n\nPROSPERO.\nAriel, thy charge\nExactly is perform\u2019d; but there\u2019s more work.\nWhat is the time o\u2019 th\u2019 day?\n\nARIEL.\nPast the mid season.\n\nPROSPERO.\nAt least two glasses. The time \u2019twixt six and now\nMust by us both be spent most preciously.\n\nARIEL.\nIs there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,\nLet me remember thee what thou hast promis\u2019d,\nWhich is not yet perform\u2019d me.\n\nPROSPERO.\nHow now! moody?\nWhat is\u2019t thou canst demand?\n\nARIEL.\nMy liberty.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBefore the time be out? No more!\n\nARIEL.\nI prithee,\nRemember I have done thee worthy service;\nTold thee no lies, made no mistakings, serv\u2019d\nWithout or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise\nTo bate me a full year.\n\nPROSPERO.\nDost thou forget\nFrom what a torment I did free thee?\n\nARIEL.\nNo.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou dost, and think\u2019st it much to tread the ooze\nOf the salt deep,\nTo run upon the sharp wind of the north,\nTo do me business in the veins o\u2019 th\u2019 earth\nWhen it is bak\u2019d with frost.\n\nARIEL.\nI do not, sir.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot\nThe foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy\nWas grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?\n\nARIEL.\nNo, sir.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou hast. Where was she born? Speak; tell me.\n\nARIEL.\nSir, in Argier.\n\nPROSPERO.\nO, was she so? I must\nOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,\nWhich thou forget\u2019st. This damn\u2019d witch Sycorax,\nFor mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible\nTo enter human hearing, from Argier,\nThou know\u2019st, was banish\u2019d: for one thing she did\nThey would not take her life. Is not this true?\n\nARIEL.\nAy, sir.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThis blue-ey\u2019d hag was hither brought with child,\nAnd here was left by th\u2019 sailors. Thou, my slave,\nAs thou report\u2019st thyself, wast then her servant;\nAnd, for thou wast a spirit too delicate\nTo act her earthy and abhorr\u2019d commands,\nRefusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,\nBy help of her more potent ministers,\nAnd in her most unmitigable rage,\nInto a cloven pine; within which rift\nImprison\u2019d, thou didst painfully remain\nA dozen years; within which space she died,\nAnd left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans\nAs fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island\u2014\nSave for the son that she did litter here,\nA freckl\u2019d whelp, hag-born\u2014not honour\u2019d with\nA human shape.\n\nARIEL.\nYes, Caliban her son.\n\nPROSPERO.\nDull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban,\nWhom now I keep in service. Thou best know\u2019st\nWhat torment I did find thee in; thy groans\nDid make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts\nOf ever-angry bears: it was a torment\nTo lay upon the damn\u2019d, which Sycorax\nCould not again undo; it was mine art,\nWhen I arriv\u2019d and heard thee, that made gape\nThe pine, and let thee out.\n\nARIEL.\nI thank thee, master.\n\nPROSPERO.\nIf thou more murmur\u2019st, I will rend an oak\nAnd peg thee in his knotty entrails till\nThou hast howl\u2019d away twelve winters.\n\nARIEL.\nPardon, master:\nI will be correspondent to command,\nAnd do my spriting gently.\n\nPROSPERO.\nDo so; and after two days\nI will discharge thee.\n\nARIEL.\nThat\u2019s my noble master!\nWhat shall I do? Say what? What shall I do?\n\nPROSPERO.\nGo make thyself like a nymph o\u2019 th\u2019 sea. Be subject\nTo no sight but thine and mine; invisible\nTo every eyeball else. Go, take this shape,\nAnd hither come in \u2019t. Go, hence with diligence!\n\n [_Exit Ariel._]\n\nAwake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;\nAwake!\n\nMIRANDA.\n[_Waking._] The strangeness of your story put\nHeaviness in me.\n\nPROSPERO.\nShake it off. Come on;\nWe\u2019ll visit Caliban my slave, who never\nYields us kind answer.\n\nMIRANDA.\n\u2019Tis a villain, sir,\nI do not love to look on.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBut as \u2019tis,\nWe cannot miss him: he does make our fire,\nFetch in our wood; and serves in offices\nThat profit us. What ho! slave! Caliban!\nThou earth, thou! Speak.\n\nCALIBAN.\n[_Within._] There\u2019s wood enough within.\n\nPROSPERO.\nCome forth, I say; there\u2019s other business for thee.\nCome, thou tortoise! when?\n\n Re-enter Ariel like a water-nymph.\n\nFine apparition! My quaint Ariel,\nHark in thine ear.\n\nARIEL.\nMy lord, it shall be done.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself\nUpon thy wicked dam, come forth!\n\n Enter Caliban.\n\nCALIBAN.\nAs wicked dew as e\u2019er my mother brush\u2019d\nWith raven\u2019s feather from unwholesome fen\nDrop on you both! A south-west blow on ye,\nAnd blister you all o\u2019er!\n\nPROSPERO.\nFor this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,\nSide-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins\nShall forth at vast of night that they may work\nAll exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinch\u2019d\nAs thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging\nThan bees that made them.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI must eat my dinner.\nThis island\u2019s mine, by Sycorax my mother,\nWhich thou tak\u2019st from me. When thou cam\u2019st first,\nThou strok\u2019st me and made much of me; wouldst give me\nWater with berries in \u2019t; and teach me how\nTo name the bigger light, and how the less,\nThat burn by day and night: and then I lov\u2019d thee,\nAnd show\u2019d thee all the qualities o\u2019 th\u2019 isle,\nThe fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place, and fertile.\nCurs\u2019d be I that did so! All the charms\nOf Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!\nFor I am all the subjects that you have,\nWhich first was mine own King; and here you sty me\nIn this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me\nThe rest o\u2019 th\u2019 island.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou most lying slave,\nWhom stripes may move, not kindness! I have us\u2019d thee,\nFilth as thou art, with human care, and lodg\u2019d thee\nIn mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate\nThe honour of my child.\n\nCALIBAN.\nOh ho! Oh ho! Would \u2019t had been done!\nThou didst prevent me; I had peopled else\nThis isle with Calibans.\n\nPROSPERO.\nAbhorred slave,\nWhich any print of goodness wilt not take,\nBeing capable of all ill!

Our hint of woe\nIs common; every day, some sailor\u2019s wife,\nThe masters of some merchant and the merchant,\nHave just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,\nI mean our preservation, few in millions\nCan speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh\nOur sorrow with our comfort.\n\nALONSO.\nPrithee, peace.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHe receives comfort like cold porridge.\n\nANTONIO.\nThe visitor will not give him o\u2019er so.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nLook, he\u2019s winding up the watch of his wit; by and by it will strike.\n\nGONZALO.\nSir,\u2014\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nOne: tell.\n\nGONZALO.\nWhen every grief is entertain\u2019d that\u2019s offer\u2019d,\nComes to the entertainer\u2014\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nA dollar.\n\nGONZALO.\nDolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken truer than you purposed.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nYou have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.\n\nGONZALO.\nTherefore, my lord,\u2014\n\nANTONIO.\nFie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!\n\nALONSO.\nI prithee, spare.\n\nGONZALO.\nWell, I have done: but yet\u2014\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHe will be talking.\n\nANTONIO.\nWhich, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nThe old cock.\n\nANTONIO.\nThe cockerel.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nDone.

How came that widow in? Widow Dido!\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhat if he had said, widower Aeneas too?\nGood Lord, how you take it!\n\nADRIAN.\nWidow Dido said you? You make me study of that; she was of Carthage,\nnot of Tunis.\n\nGONZALO.\nThis Tunis, sir, was Carthage.\n\nADRIAN.\nCarthage?\n\nGONZALO.\nI assure you, Carthage.\n\nANTONIO.\nHis word is more than the miraculous harp.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHe hath rais\u2019d the wall, and houses too.\n\nANTONIO.\nWhat impossible matter will he make easy next?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his\nson for an apple.\n\nANTONIO.\nAnd, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.\n\nALONSO.\nAy.\n\nANTONIO.\nWhy, in good time.\n\nGONZALO.\n[_To Alonso._] Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh\nas when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now\nQueen.\n\nANTONIO.\nAnd the rarest that e\u2019er came there.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nBate, I beseech you, widow Dido.\n\nANTONIO.\nO! widow Dido; ay, widow Dido.\n\nGONZALO.\nIs not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in\na sort.\n\nANTONIO.\nThat sort was well fish\u2019d for.\n\nGONZALO.\nWhen I wore it at your daughter\u2019s marriage?\n\nALONSO.\nYou cram these words into mine ears against\nThe stomach of my sense. Would I had never\nMarried my daughter there! for, coming thence,\nMy son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,\nWho is so far from Italy removed,\nI ne\u2019er again shall see her. O thou mine heir\nOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fish\nHath made his meal on thee?\n\nFRANCISCO.\nSir, he may live:\nI saw him beat the surges under him,\nAnd ride upon their backs. He trod the water,\nWhose enmity he flung aside, and breasted\nThe surge most swoln that met him. His bold head\n\u2019Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared\nHimself with his good arms in lusty stroke\nTo th\u2019 shore, that o\u2019er his wave-worn basis bowed,\nAs stooping to relieve him. I not doubt\nHe came alive to land.\n\nALONSO.\nNo, no, he\u2019s gone.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nSir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,\nThat would not bless our Europe with your daughter,\nBut rather lose her to an African;\nWhere she, at least, is banish\u2019d from your eye,\nWho hath cause to wet the grief on \u2019t.\n\nALONSO.\nPrithee, peace.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nYou were kneel\u2019d to, and importun\u2019d otherwise\nBy all of us; and the fair soul herself\nWeigh\u2019d between loathness and obedience at\nWhich end o\u2019 th\u2019 beam should bow. We have lost your son,\nI fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have\nMore widows in them of this business\u2019 making,\nThan we bring men to comfort them.\nThe fault\u2019s your own.\n\nALONSO.\nSo is the dear\u2019st o\u2019 th\u2019 loss.\n\nGONZALO.\nMy lord Sebastian,\nThe truth you speak doth lack some gentleness\nAnd time to speak it in. You rub the sore,\nWhen you should bring the plaster.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nVery well.\n\nANTONIO.\nAnd most chirurgeonly.\n\nGONZALO.\nIt is foul weather in us all, good sir,\nWhen you are cloudy.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nFoul weather?\n\nANTONIO.\nVery foul.\n\nGONZALO.\nHad I plantation of this isle, my lord,\u2014\n\nANTONIO.\nHe\u2019d sow \u2019t with nettle-seed.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nOr docks, or mallows.\n\nGONZALO.\nAnd were the King on\u2019t, what would I do?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\n\u2019Scape being drunk for want of wine.\n\nGONZALO.\nI\u2019 th\u2019 commonwealth I would by contraries\nExecute all things; for no kind of traffic\nWould I admit; no name of magistrate;\nLetters should not be known; riches, poverty,\nAnd use of service, none; contract, succession,\nBourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\nNo use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\nNo occupation; all men idle, all;\nAnd women too, but innocent and pure;\nNo sovereignty,\u2014\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nYet he would be King on\u2019t.\n\nANTONIO.\nThe latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.\n\nGONZALO.\nAll things in common nature should produce\nWithout sweat or endeavour; treason, felony,\nSword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,\nWould I not have; but nature should bring forth,\nOf it own kind, all foison, all abundance,\nTo feed my innocent people.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nNo marrying \u2019mong his subjects?\n\nANTONIO.\nNone, man; all idle; whores and knaves.\n\nGONZALO.\nI would with such perfection govern, sir,\nT\u2019 excel the Golden Age.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nSave his Majesty!\n\nANTONIO.\nLong live Gonzalo!\n\nGONZALO.\nAnd,\u2014do you mark me, sir?\n\nALONSO.\nPrithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.\n\nGONZALO.\nI do well believe your highness; and did it to minister occasion to\nthese gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they\nalways use to laugh at nothing.\n\nANTONIO.\n\u2019Twas you we laughed at.\n\nGONZALO.\nWho in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you. So you may\ncontinue, and laugh at nothing still.\n\nANTONIO.\nWhat a blow was there given!\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nAn it had not fallen flat-long.\n\nGONZALO.\nYou are gentlemen of brave mettle. You would lift the moon out of her\nsphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.\n\n Enter Ariel, invisible, playing solemn music.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWe would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.\n\nANTONIO.\nNay, good my lord, be not angry.\n\nGONZALO.\nNo, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will\nyou laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?\n\nANTONIO.\nGo sleep, and hear us.\n\n [_All sleep but Alonso, Sebastian and Antonio._]\n\nALONSO.\nWhat, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes\nWould, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find\nThey are inclin\u2019d to do so.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nPlease you, sir,\nDo not omit the heavy offer of it:\nIt seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,\nIt is a comforter.\n\nANTONIO.\nWe two, my lord,\nWill guard your person while you take your rest,\nAnd watch your safety.\n\nALONSO.\nThank you. Wondrous heavy!\n\n [_Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel._]\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhat a strange drowsiness possesses them!\n\nANTONIO.\nIt is the quality o\u2019 th\u2019 climate.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhy\nDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not\nMyself dispos\u2019d to sleep.\n\nANTONIO.\nNor I. My spirits are nimble.\nThey fell together all, as by consent;\nThey dropp\u2019d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,\nWorthy Sebastian? O, what might?\u2014No more.\nAnd yet methinks I see it in thy face,\nWhat thou shouldst be. Th\u2019 occasion speaks thee; and\nMy strong imagination sees a crown\nDropping upon thy head.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhat, art thou waking?\n\nANTONIO.\nDo you not hear me speak?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI do; and surely\nIt is a sleepy language, and thou speak\u2019st\nOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleep\nWith eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,\nAnd yet so fast asleep.\n\nANTONIO.\nNoble Sebastian,\nThou let\u2019st thy fortune sleep\u2014die rather; wink\u2019st\nWhiles thou art waking.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nThou dost snore distinctly:\nThere\u2019s meaning in thy snores.\n\nANTONIO.\nI am more serious than my custom; you\nMust be so too, if heed me; which to do\nTrebles thee o\u2019er.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWell, I am standing water.\n\nANTONIO.\nI\u2019ll teach you how to flow.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nDo so: to ebb,\nHereditary sloth instructs me.\n\nANTONIO.\nO,\nIf you but knew how you the purpose cherish\nWhiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,\nYou more invest it! Ebbing men indeed,\nMost often, do so near the bottom run\nBy their own fear or sloth.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nPrithee, say on:\nThe setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim\nA matter from thee, and a birth, indeed\nWhich throes thee much to yield.\n\nANTONIO.\nThus, sir:\nAlthough this lord of weak remembrance, this\nWho shall be of as little memory\nWhen he is earth\u2019d, hath here almost persuaded,\u2014\nFor he\u2019s a spirit of persuasion, only\nProfesses to persuade,\u2014the King his son\u2019s alive,\n\u2019Tis as impossible that he\u2019s undrown\u2019d\nAs he that sleeps here swims.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI have no hope\nThat he\u2019s undrown\u2019d.\n\nANTONIO.\nO, out of that \u201cno hope\u201d\nWhat great hope have you! No hope that way is\nAnother way so high a hope, that even\nAmbition cannot pierce a wink beyond,\nBut doubts discovery there. Will you grant with me\nThat Ferdinand is drown\u2019d?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHe\u2019s gone.\n\nANTONIO.\nThen tell me,\nWho\u2019s the next heir of Naples?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nClaribel.\n\nANTONIO.\nShe that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells\nTen leagues beyond man\u2019s life; she that from Naples\nCan have no note, unless the sun were post\u2014\nThe Man i\u2019 th\u2019 Moon\u2019s too slow\u2014till newborn chins\nBe rough and razorable; she that from whom\nWe all were sea-swallow\u2019d, though some cast again,\nAnd by that destiny, to perform an act\nWhereof what\u2019s past is prologue, what to come\nIn yours and my discharge.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhat stuff is this! How say you?\n\u2019Tis true, my brother\u2019s daughter\u2019s Queen of Tunis;\nSo is she heir of Naples; \u2019twixt which regions\nThere is some space.\n\nANTONIO.\nA space whose ev\u2019ry cubit\nSeems to cry out \u201cHow shall that Claribel\nMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,\nAnd let Sebastian wake.\u201d Say this were death\nThat now hath seiz\u2019d them; why, they were no worse\nThan now they are. There be that can rule Naples\nAs well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate\nAs amply and unnecessarily\nAs this Gonzalo. I myself could make\nA chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore\nThe mind that I do! What a sleep were this\nFor your advancement! Do you understand me?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nMethinks I do.\n\nANTONIO.\nAnd how does your content\nTender your own good fortune?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI remember\nYou did supplant your brother Prospero.\n\nANTONIO.\nTrue.\nAnd look how well my garments sit upon me;\nMuch feater than before; my brother\u2019s servants\nWere then my fellows; now they are my men.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nBut, for your conscience.\n\nANTONIO.\nAy, sir; where lies that? If \u2019twere a kibe,\n\u2019Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not\nThis deity in my bosom: twenty consciences\nThat stand \u2019twixt me and Milan, candied be they\nAnd melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,\nNo better than the earth he lies upon,\nIf he were that which now he\u2019s like, that\u2019s dead;\nWhom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,\nCan lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,\nTo the perpetual wink for aye might put\nThis ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who\nShould not upbraid our course. For all the rest,\nThey\u2019ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.\nThey\u2019ll tell the clock to any business that\nWe say befits the hour.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nThy case, dear friend,\nShall be my precedent: as thou got\u2019st Milan,\nI\u2019ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke\nShall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,\nAnd I the King shall love thee.\n\nANTONIO.\nDraw together,\nAnd when I rear my hand, do you the like,\nTo fall it on Gonzalo.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nO, but one word.\n\n [_They converse apart._]\n\n Music. Re-enter Ariel, invisible.\n\nARIEL.\nMy master through his art foresees the danger\nThat you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth\u2014\nFor else his project dies\u2014to keep them living.\n\n[_Sings in Gonzalo\u2019s ear._]\n_While you here do snoring lie,\nOpen-ey\u2019d conspiracy\n    His time doth take.\nIf of life you keep a care,\nShake off slumber, and beware.\n    Awake! awake!_\n\nANTONIO.\nThen let us both be sudden.\n\nGONZALO.\nNow, good angels\nPreserve the King!\n\n [_They wake._]\n\nALONSO.\nWhy, how now! Ho, awake! Why are you drawn?\nWherefore this ghastly looking?\n\nGONZALO.\nWhat\u2019s the matter?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhiles we stood here securing your repose,\nEven now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing\nLike bulls, or rather lions; did \u2019t not wake you?\nIt struck mine ear most terribly.\n\nALONSO.\nI heard nothing.\n\nANTONIO.\nO! \u2019twas a din to fright a monster\u2019s ear,\nTo make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roar\nOf a whole herd of lions.\n\nALONSO.\nHeard you this, Gonzalo?\n\nGONZALO.\nUpon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,\nAnd that a strange one too, which did awake me.\nI shak\u2019d you, sir, and cried; as mine eyes open\u2019d,\nI saw their weapons drawn:\u2014there was a noise,\nThat\u2019s verily. \u2019Tis best we stand upon our guard,\nOr that we quit this place: let\u2019s draw our weapons.\n\nALONSO.\nLead off this ground, and let\u2019s make further search\nFor my poor son.\n\nGONZALO.\nHeavens keep him from these beasts!\nFor he is, sure, i\u2019 th\u2019 island.\n\nALONSO.\nLead away.\n\n [_Exit with the others._]\n\nARIEL.\nProspero my lord shall know what I have done:\nSo, King, go safely on to seek thy son.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II. Another part of the island.\n\n Enter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard.\n\nCALIBAN.\nAll the infections that the sun sucks up\nFrom bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him\nBy inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,\nAnd yet I needs must curse. But they\u2019ll nor pinch,\nFright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i\u2019 the mire,\nNor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark\nOut of my way, unless he bid \u2019em; but\nFor every trifle are they set upon me,\nSometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,\nAnd after bite me; then like hedgehogs which\nLie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount\nTheir pricks at my footfall; sometime am I\nAll wound with adders, who with cloven tongues\nDo hiss me into madness.\n\n Enter Trinculo.\n\nLo, now, lo!\nHere comes a spirit of his, and to torment me\nFor bringing wood in slowly. I\u2019ll fall flat;\nPerchance he will not mind me.\n\nTRINCULO.\nHere\u2019s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all, and\nanother storm brewing; I hear it sing i\u2019 th\u2019 wind. Yond same black\ncloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his\nliquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide\nmy head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have\nwe here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish;\na very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest\nPoor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and\nhad but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a\npiece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast\nthere makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame\nbeggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg\u2019d like a man,\nand his fins like arms! Warm, o\u2019 my troth! I do now let loose my\nopinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath\nlately suffered by thunderbolt. [_Thunder._] Alas, the storm is come\nagain! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other\nshelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. I\nwill here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.\n\n Enter Stephano singing; a bottle in his hand.\n\nSTEPHANO.\n_I shall no more to sea, to sea,\nHere shall I die ashore\u2014_\n\nThis is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man\u2019s funeral.\nWell, here\u2019s my comfort.\n\n [_Drinks._]\n\n_The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,\n    The gunner, and his mate,\nLov\u2019d Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,\n    But none of us car\u2019d for Kate:\n    For she had a tongue with a tang,\n    Would cry to a sailor \u201cGo hang!\u201d\nShe lov\u2019d not the savour of tar nor of pitch,\nYet a tailor might scratch her where\u2019er she did itch.\n    Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang._\n\nThis is a scurvy tune too: but here\u2019s my comfort.\n\n [_Drinks._]\n\nCALIBAN.\nDo not torment me: O!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nWhat\u2019s the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon \u2019s with\nsavages and men of Ind? Ha? I have not scap\u2019d drowning, to be afeard\nnow of your four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever\nwent on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be said so\nagain, while Stephano breathes at\u2019 nostrils.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThe spirit torments me: O!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThis is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I\ntake it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will\ngive him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him and\nkeep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he\u2019s a present for any\nemperor that ever trod on neat\u2019s-leather.\n\nCALIBAN.\nDo not torment me, prithee; I\u2019ll bring my wood home faster.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHe\u2019s in his fit now, and does not talk after the wisest. He shall taste\nof my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to\nremove his fit. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, I will not\ntake too much for him. He shall pay for him that hath him, and that\nsoundly.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,\nI know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nCome on your ways. Open your mouth; here is that which will give\nlanguage to you, cat. Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I\ncan tell you, and that soundly. [_gives Caliban a drink_] You cannot\ntell who\u2019s your friend: open your chaps again.\n\nTRINCULO.\nI should know that voice: it should be\u2014but he is drowned; and these are\ndevils. O, defend me!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nFour legs and two voices; a most delicate monster! His forward voice\nnow is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul\nspeeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover him,\nI will help his ague. Come. Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth.\n\nTRINCULO.\nStephano!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nDoth thy other mouth call me? Mercy! mercy!\nThis is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I\nhave no long spoon.\n\nTRINCULO.\nStephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am\nTrinculo\u2014be not afeared\u2014thy good friend Trinculo.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nIf thou beest Trinculo, come forth. I\u2019ll pull thee by the lesser legs:\nif any be Trinculo\u2019s legs, these are they. Thou art very Trinculo\nindeed! How cam\u2019st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? Can he vent\nTrinculos?\n\nTRINCULO.\nI took him to be kill\u2019d with a thunderstroke. But art thou not drown\u2019d,\nStephano? I hope now thou are not drown\u2019d. Is the storm overblown? I\nhid me under the dead moon-calf\u2019s gaberdine for fear of the storm. And\nart thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scap\u2019d!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nPrithee, do not turn me about. My stomach is not constant.\n\nCALIBAN.\n[_Aside._] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.\nThat\u2019s a brave god, and bears celestial liquor.\nI will kneel to him.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHow didst thou scape? How cam\u2019st thou hither? Swear by  this bottle how\nthou cam\u2019st hither\u2014I escaped upon a butt of sack, which the sailors\nheaved o\u2019erboard, by this bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree\nwith mine own hands, since I was cast ashore.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI\u2019ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the liquor is\nnot earthly.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHere. Swear then how thou escapedst.\n\nTRINCULO.\nSwum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim like a duck, I\u2019ll be sworn.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHere, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made\nlike a goose.\n\nTRINCULO.\nO Stephano, hast any more of this?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThe whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by th\u2019 seaside, where my\nwine is hid. How now, moon-calf! How does thine ague?\n\nCALIBAN.\nHast thou not dropped from heaven?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nOut o\u2019 the moon, I do assure thee: I was the Man in the Moon, when time\nwas.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee. My mistress showed me\nthee, and thy dog, and thy bush.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nCome, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will furnish it anon with new\ncontents. Swear.\n\nTRINCULO.\nBy this good light, this is a very shallow monster. I afeard of him? A\nvery weak monster. The Man i\u2019 the Moon! A most poor credulous monster!\nWell drawn, monster, in good sooth!\n\nCALIBAN.\nI\u2019ll show thee every fertile inch o\u2019 the island; and I will kiss thy\nfoot. I prithee, be my god.\n\nTRINCULO.\nBy this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster. When \u2019s god\u2019s\nasleep, he\u2019ll rob his bottle.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI\u2019ll kiss thy foot. I\u2019ll swear myself thy subject.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nCome on, then; down, and swear.\n\nTRINCULO.\nI shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster. A most\nscurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him,\u2014\n\nSTEPHANO.\nCome, kiss.\n\nTRINCULO.\nBut that the poor monster\u2019s in drink. An abominable monster!\n\nCALIBAN.\nI\u2019ll show thee the best springs; I\u2019ll pluck thee berries;\nI\u2019ll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.\nA plague upon the tyrant that I serve!\nI\u2019ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,\nThou wondrous man.\n\nTRINCULO.\nA most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!\n\nCALIBAN.\nI prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;\nAnd I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;\nShow thee a jay\u2019s nest, and instruct thee how\nTo snare the nimble marmoset; I\u2019ll bring thee\nTo clustering filberts, and sometimes I\u2019ll get thee\nYoung scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nI prithee now, lead the way without any more talking. Trinculo, the\nKing and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here.\nHere, bear my bottle. Fellow Trinculo, we\u2019ll fill him by and by again.\n\nCALIBAN.\n[_Sings drunkenly._] _Farewell, master; farewell, farewell!_\n\nTRINCULO.\nA howling monster, a drunken monster.\n\nCALIBAN.\n_No more dams I\u2019ll make for fish;\nNor fetch in firing\nAt requiring,\nNor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish;\n\u2019Ban \u2019Ban, Cacaliban,\nHas a new master\u2014Get a new man._\nFreedom, high-day! high-day, freedom! freedom,\nhigh-day, freedom!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nO brave monster! lead the way.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT III.\n\nSCENE I. Before Prospero\u2019s cell.\n\n Enter Ferdinand bearing a log.\n\nFERDINAND.\nThere be some sports are painful, and their labour\nDelight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness\nAre nobly undergone; and most poor matters\nPoint to rich ends. This my mean task\nWould be as heavy to me as odious, but\nThe mistress which I serve quickens what\u2019s dead,\nAnd makes my labours pleasures: O, she is\nTen times more gentle than her father\u2019s crabbed,\nAnd he\u2019s compos\u2019d of harshness. I must remove\nSome thousands of these logs, and pile them up,\nUpon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress\nWeeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness\nHad never like executor. I forget:\nBut these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,\nMost busy, least when I do it.\n\n Enter Miranda and Prospero behind.\n\nMIRANDA.\nAlas now, pray you,\nWork not so hard: I would the lightning had\nBurnt up those logs that you are enjoin\u2019d to pile!\nPray, set it down and rest you. When this burns,\n\u2019Twill weep for having wearied you. My father\nIs hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself:\nHe\u2019s safe for these three hours.\n\nFERDINAND.\nO most dear mistress,\nThe sun will set, before I shall discharge\nWhat I must strive to do.\n\nMIRANDA.\nIf you\u2019ll sit down,\nI\u2019ll bear your logs the while. Pray give me that;\nI\u2019ll carry it to the pile.\n\nFERDINAND.\nNo, precious creature;\nI had rather crack my sinews, break my back,\nThan you should such dishonour undergo,\nWhile I sit lazy by.\n\nMIRANDA.\nIt would become me\nAs well as it does you: and I should do it\nWith much more ease; for my good will is to it,\nAnd yours it is against.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[_Aside._] Poor worm! thou art infected.\nThis visitation shows it.\n\nMIRANDA.\nYou look wearily.\n\nFERDINAND.\nNo, noble mistress; \u2019tis fresh morning with me\nWhen you are by at night. I do beseech you\u2014\nChiefly that I might set it in my prayers\u2014\nWhat is your name?\n\nMIRANDA.\nMiranda\u2014O my father!\nI have broke your hest to say so.\n\nFERDINAND.\nAdmir\u2019d Miranda!\nIndeed, the top of admiration; worth\nWhat\u2019s dearest to the world! Full many a lady\nI have ey\u2019d with best regard, and many a time\nTh\u2019 harmony of their tongues hath into bondage\nBrought my too diligent ear: for several virtues\nHave I lik\u2019d several women; never any\nWith so full soul but some defect in her\nDid quarrel with the noblest grace she ow\u2019d,\nAnd put it to the foil: but you, O you,\nSo perfect and so peerless, are created\nOf every creature\u2019s best.\n\nMIRANDA.\nI do not know\nOne of my sex; no woman\u2019s face remember,\nSave, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen\nMore that I may call men than you, good friend,\nAnd my dear father: how features are abroad,\nI am skilless of; but, by my modesty,\nThe jewel in my dower, I would not wish\nAny companion in the world but you;\nNor can imagination form a shape,\nBesides yourself, to like of. But I prattle\nSomething too wildly, and my father\u2019s precepts\nI therein do forget.\n\nFERDINAND.\nI am, in my condition,\nA prince, Miranda; I do think, a King;\nI would not so!\u2014and would no more endure\nThis wooden slavery than to suffer\nThe flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:\nThe very instant that I saw you, did\nMy heart fly to your service; there resides,\nTo make me slave to it; and for your sake\nAm I this patient log-man.\n\nMIRANDA.\nDo you love me?\n\nFERDINAND.\nO heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,\nAnd crown what I profess with kind event,\nIf I speak true; if hollowly, invert\nWhat best is boded me to mischief! I,\nBeyond all limit of what else i\u2019 the world,\nDo love, prize, honour you.\n\nMIRANDA.\nI am a fool\nTo weep at what I am glad of.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[_Aside._] Fair encounter\nOf two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace\nOn that which breeds between \u2019em!\n\nFERDINAND.\nWherefore weep you?\n\nMIRANDA.\nAt mine unworthiness, that dare not offer\nWhat I desire to give; and much less take\nWhat I shall die to want. But this is trifling;\nAnd all the more it seeks to hide itself,\nThe bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!\nAnd prompt me, plain and holy innocence!\nI am your wife if you will marry me;\nIf not, I\u2019ll die your maid: to be your fellow\nYou may deny me; but I\u2019ll be your servant,\nWhether you will or no.\n\nFERDINAND.\nMy mistress, dearest;\nAnd I thus humble ever.\n\nMIRANDA.\nMy husband, then?\n\nFERDINAND.\nAy, with a heart as willing\nAs bondage e\u2019er of freedom: here\u2019s my hand.\n\nMIRANDA.\nAnd mine, with my heart in \u2019t: and now farewell\nTill half an hour hence.\n\nFERDINAND.\nA thousand thousand!\n\n [_Exeunt Ferdinand and Miranda severally._]\n\nPROSPERO.\nSo glad of this as they, I cannot be,\nWho are surpris\u2019d withal; but my rejoicing\nAt nothing can be more. I\u2019ll to my book;\nFor yet, ere supper time, must I perform\nMuch business appertaining.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II. Another part of the island.\n\n Enter Caliban with a bottle, Stephano and Trinculo.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nTell not me:\u2014when the butt is out we will drink water; not a drop\nbefore: therefore bear up, and board \u2019em. Servant-monster, drink to me.\n\nTRINCULO.\nServant-monster! The folly of this island! They say there\u2019s but five\nupon this isle; we are three of them; if th\u2019 other two be brained like\nus, the state totters.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nDrink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes are almost set in thy\nhead.\n\nTRINCULO.\nWhere should they be set else? He were a brave monster indeed, if they\nwere set in his tail.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMy man-monster hath drown\u2019d his tongue in sack: for my part, the sea\ncannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty\nleagues, off and on, by this light. Thou shalt be my lieutenant,\nmonster, or my standard.\n\nTRINCULO.\nYour lieutenant, if you list; he\u2019s no standard.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nWe\u2019ll not run, Monsieur monster.\n\nTRINCULO.\nNor go neither. But you\u2019ll lie like dogs, and yet say nothing neither.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMoon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good moon-calf.\n\nCALIBAN.\nHow does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. I\u2019ll not serve him, he is\nnot valiant.\n\nTRINCULO.\nThou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a constable.\nWhy, thou deboshed fish thou, was there ever man a coward that hath\ndrunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being\nbut half a fish and half a monster?\n\nCALIBAN.\nLo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?\n\nTRINCULO.\n\u201cLord\u201d quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!\n\nCALIBAN.\nLo, lo again! bite him to death, I prithee.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nTrinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer, the\nnext tree! The poor monster\u2019s my subject, and he shall not suffer\nindignity.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleas\u2019d to hearken once again to\nthe suit I made to thee?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMarry. will I. Kneel and repeat it. I will stand, and so shall\nTrinculo.\n\n Enter Ariel, invisible.\n\nCALIBAN.\nAs I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by\nhis cunning hath cheated me of the island.\n\nARIEL.\nThou liest.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou;\nI would my valiant master would destroy thee;\nI do not lie.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nTrinculo, if you trouble him any more in his tale, by this hand, I will\nsupplant some of your teeth.\n\nTRINCULO.\nWhy, I said nothing.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMum, then, and no more. Proceed.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI say, by sorcery he got this isle;\nFrom me he got it. If thy greatness will,\nRevenge it on him,\u2014for I know thou dar\u2019st;\nBut this thing dare not,\u2014\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThat\u2019s most certain.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThou shalt be lord of it and I\u2019ll serve thee.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHow now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the party?\n\nCALIBAN.\nYea, yea, my lord: I\u2019ll yield him thee asleep,\nWhere thou mayst knock a nail into his head.\n\nARIEL.\nThou liest. Thou canst not.\n\nCALIBAN.\nWhat a pied ninny\u2019s this! Thou scurvy patch!\nI do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,\nAnd take his bottle from him: when that\u2019s gone\nHe shall drink nought but brine; for I\u2019ll not show him\nWhere the quick freshes are.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nTrinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word\nfurther, and by this hand, I\u2019ll turn my mercy out o\u2019 doors, and make a\nstock-fish of thee.\n\nTRINCULO.\nWhy, what did I? I did nothing. I\u2019ll go farther off.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nDidst thou not say he lied?\n\nARIEL.\nThou liest.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nDo I so? Take thou that.\n\n [_Strikes Trinculo._]\n\nAs you like this, give me the lie another time.\n\nTRINCULO.\nI did not give the lie. Out o\u2019 your wits and hearing too? A pox o\u2019 your\nbottle! this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and\nthe devil take your fingers!\n\nCALIBAN.\nHa, ha, ha!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nNow, forward with your tale.\u2014Prithee stand further off.\n\nCALIBAN.\nBeat him enough: after a little time,\nI\u2019ll beat him too.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nStand farther.\u2014Come, proceed.\n\nCALIBAN.\nWhy, as I told thee, \u2019tis a custom with him\nI\u2019 th\u2019 afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,\nHaving first seiz\u2019d his books; or with a log\nBatter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,\nOr cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember\nFirst to possess his books; for without them\nHe\u2019s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not\nOne spirit to command: they all do hate him\nAs rootedly as I. Burn but his books.\nHe has brave utensils,\u2014for so he calls them,\u2014\nWhich, when he has a house, he\u2019ll deck withal.\nAnd that most deeply to consider is\nThe beauty of his daughter; he himself\nCalls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman\nBut only Sycorax my dam and she;\nBut she as far surpasseth Sycorax\nAs great\u2019st does least.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nIs it so brave a lass?\n\nCALIBAN.\nAy, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,\nAnd bring thee forth brave brood.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMonster, I will kill this man. His daughter and I will be king and\nqueen,\u2014save our graces!\u2014and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.\nDost thou like the plot, Trinculo?\n\nTRINCULO.\nExcellent.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nGive me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but while thou liv\u2019st, keep a\ngood tongue in thy head.\n\nCALIBAN.\nWithin this half hour will he be asleep.\nWilt thou destroy him then?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nAy, on mine honour.\n\nARIEL.\nThis will I tell my master.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThou mak\u2019st me merry. I am full of pleasure.\nLet us be jocund: will you troll the catch\nYou taught me but while-ere?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nAt thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason. Come on,\nTrinculo, let us sing.\n\n[_Sings._]\n\n_Flout \u2019em and cout \u2019em,\nand scout \u2019em and flout \u2019em:\n    Thought is free._\n\nCALIBAN.\nThat\u2019s not the tune.\n\n [_Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe._]\n\nSTEPHANO.\nWhat is this same?\n\nTRINCULO.\nThis is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nIf thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness: if thou beest a\ndevil, take \u2019t as thou list.\n\nTRINCULO.\nO, forgive me my sins!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHe that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!\n\nCALIBAN.\nArt thou afeard?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nNo, monster, not I.\n\nCALIBAN.\nBe not afeard. The isle is full of noises,\nSounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.\nSometimes a thousand twangling instruments\nWill hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,\nThat, if I then had wak\u2019d after long sleep,\nWill make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,\nThe clouds methought would open and show riches\nReady to drop upon me; that, when I wak\u2019d,\nI cried to dream again.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThis will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for\nnothing.\n\nCALIBAN.\nWhen Prospero is destroyed.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThat shall be by and by: I remember the story.\n\nTRINCULO.\nThe sound is going away. Let\u2019s follow it, and after do our work.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nLead, monster: we\u2019ll follow. I would I could see this taborer! he lays\nit on. Wilt come?\n\nTRINCULO.\nI\u2019ll follow, Stephano.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Another part of the island.\n\n Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo Adrian, Francisco, &c.\n\nGONZALO.\nBy \u2019r lakin, I can go no further, sir;\nMy old bones ache: here\u2019s a maze trod, indeed,\nThrough forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,\nI needs must rest me.\n\nALONSO.\nOld lord, I cannot blame thee,\nWho am myself attach\u2019d with weariness\nTo th\u2019 dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.\nEven here I will put off my hope, and keep it\nNo longer for my flatterer: he is drown\u2019d\nWhom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks\nOur frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.\n\nANTONIO.\n[_Aside to Sebastian._] I am right glad that he\u2019s\nso out of hope.\nDo not, for one repulse, forgo the purpose\nThat you resolv\u2019d to effect.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\n[_Aside to Antonio._] The next advantage\nWill we take throughly.\n\nANTONIO.\n[_Aside to Sebastian._] Let it be tonight;\nFor, now they are oppress\u2019d with travel, they\nWill not, nor cannot, use such vigilance\nAs when they are fresh.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\n[_Aside to Antonio._] I say, tonight: no more.\n\n Solemn and strange music: and Prospero above, invisible. Enter several\n strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet: they dance about it with gentle\n actions of salutation; and inviting the King &c., to eat, they depart.\n\nALONSO.\nWhat harmony is this? My good friends, hark!\n\nGONZALO.\nMarvellous sweet music!\n\nALONSO.\nGive us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nA living drollery. Now I will believe\nThat there are unicorns; that in Arabia\nThere is one tree, the phoenix\u2019 throne; one phoenix\nAt this hour reigning there.\n\nANTONIO.\nI\u2019ll believe both;\nAnd what does else want credit, come to me,\nAnd I\u2019ll be sworn \u2019tis true: travellers ne\u2019er did lie,\nThough fools at home condemn them.\n\nGONZALO.\nIf in Naples\nI should report this now, would they believe me?\nIf I should say, I saw such islanders,\u2014\nFor, certes, these are people of the island,\u2014\nWho, though, they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,\nTheir manners are more gentle, kind, than of\nOur human generation you shall find\nMany, nay, almost any.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[_Aside._] Honest lord,\nThou hast said well; for some of you there present\nAre worse than devils.\n\nALONSO.\nI cannot too much muse\nSuch shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing\u2014\nAlthough they want the use of tongue\u2014a kind\nOf excellent dumb discourse.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[_Aside._] Praise in departing.\n\nFRANCISCO.\nThey vanish\u2019d strangely.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nNo matter, since\nThey have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.\u2014\nWill\u2019t please you taste of what is here?\n\nALONSO.\nNot I.\n\nGONZALO.\nFaith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,\nWho would believe that there were mountaineers\nDewlapp\u2019d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at \u2019em\nWallets of flesh? Or that there were such men\nWhose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find\nEach putter-out of five for one will bring us\nGood warrant of.\n\nALONSO.\nI will stand to, and feed,\nAlthough my last, no matter, since I feel\nThe best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,\nStand to, and do as we.\n\n Thunder and lightning. Enter Ariel like a Harpy; claps his wings upon\n the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes.\n\nARIEL.\nYou are three men of sin, whom Destiny,\nThat hath to instrument this lower world\nAnd what is in\u2019t,\u2014the never-surfeited sea\nHath caused to belch up you; and on this island\nWhere man doth not inhabit; you \u2019mongst men\nBeing most unfit to live. I have made you mad;\nAnd even with such-like valour men hang and drown\nTheir proper selves.\n\n [_Seeing Alonso, Sebastian &c., draw their swords._]\n\nYou fools! I and my fellows\nAre ministers of Fate: the elements\nOf whom your swords are temper\u2019d may as well\nWound the loud winds, or with bemock\u2019d-at stabs\nKill the still-closing waters, as diminish\nOne dowle that\u2019s in my plume. My fellow-ministers\nAre like invulnerable. If you could hurt,\nYour swords are now too massy for your strengths,\nAnd will not be uplifted. But, remember\u2014\nFor that\u2019s my business to you,\u2014that you three\nFrom Milan did supplant good Prospero;\nExpos\u2019d unto the sea, which hath requit it,\nHim and his innocent child: for which foul deed\nThe powers, delaying, not forgetting, have\nIncens\u2019d the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,\nAgainst your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,\nThey have bereft; and do pronounce, by me\nLing\u2019ring perdition,\u2014worse than any death\nCan be at once,\u2014shall step by step attend\nYou and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from\u2014\nWhich here, in this most desolate isle, else falls\nUpon your heads,\u2014is nothing but heart-sorrow,\nAnd a clear life ensuing.\n\n [_He vanishes in thunder: then, to soft music, enter the Shapes again,\n and dance, with mocks and mows, and carry out the table._]\n\nPROSPERO.\n[_Aside._] Bravely the figure of this Harpy hast thou\nPerform\u2019d, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring.\nOf my instruction hast thou nothing bated\nIn what thou hadst to say: so, with good life\nAnd observation strange, my meaner ministers\nTheir several kinds have done. My high charms work,\nAnd these mine enemies are all knit up\nIn their distractions; they now are in my power;\nAnd in these fits I leave them, while I visit\nYoung Ferdinand,\u2014whom they suppose is drown\u2019d,\u2014\nAnd his and mine lov\u2019d darling.\n\n [_Exit above._]\n\nGONZALO.\nI\u2019 the name of something holy, sir, why stand you\nIn this strange stare?\n\nALONSO.\nO, it is monstrous! monstrous!\nMethought the billows spoke, and told me of it;\nThe winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,\nThat deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounc\u2019d\nThe name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.\nTherefore my son i\u2019 th\u2019 ooze is bedded; and\nI\u2019ll seek him deeper than e\u2019er plummet sounded,\nAnd with him there lie mudded.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nBut one fiend at a time,\nI\u2019ll fight their legions o\u2019er.\n\nANTONIO.\nI\u2019ll be thy second.\n\n [_Exeunt Sebastian and Antonio._]\n\nGONZALO.\nAll three of them are desperate: their great guilt,\nLike poison given to work a great time after,\nNow \u2019gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you\nThat are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly\nAnd hinder them from what this ecstasy\nMay now provoke them to.\n\nADRIAN.\nFollow, I pray you.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT IV.\n\nSCENE I. Before Prospero\u2019s cell.\n\n Enter Prospero, Ferdinand and Miranda.\n\nPROSPERO.\nIf I have too austerely punish\u2019d you,\nYour compensation makes amends: for I\nHave given you here a third of mine own life,\nOr that for which I live; who once again\nI tender to thy hand: all thy vexations\nWere but my trials of thy love, and thou\nHast strangely stood the test: here, afore Heaven,\nI ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,\nDo not smile at me that I boast her off,\nFor thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,\nAnd make it halt behind her.\n\nFERDINAND.\nI do believe it\nAgainst an oracle.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThen, as my gift and thine own acquisition\nWorthily purchas\u2019d, take my daughter: but\nIf thou dost break her virgin knot before\nAll sanctimonious ceremonies may\nWith full and holy rite be minister\u2019d,\nNo sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall\nTo make this contract grow; but barren hate,\nSour-ey\u2019d disdain, and discord shall bestrew\nThe union of your bed with weeds so loathly\nThat you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,\nAs Hymen\u2019s lamps shall light you.\n\nFERDINAND.\nAs I hope\nFor quiet days, fair issue, and long life,\nWith such love as \u2019tis now, the murkiest den,\nThe most opportune place, the strong\u2019st suggestion\nOur worser genius can, shall never melt\nMine honour into lust, to take away\nThe edge of that day\u2019s celebration,\nWhen I shall think, or Phoebus\u2019 steeds are founder\u2019d,\nOr Night kept chain\u2019d below.\n\nPROSPERO.\nFairly spoke:\nSit, then, and talk with her, she is thine own.\nWhat, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!\n\n Enter Ariel.\n\nARIEL.\nWhat would my potent master? here I am.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou and thy meaner fellows your last service\nDid worthily perform; and I must use you\nIn such another trick. Go bring the rabble,\nO\u2019er whom I give thee power, here to this place.\nIncite them to quick motion; for I must\nBestow upon the eyes of this young couple\nSome vanity of mine art: it is my promise,\nAnd they expect it from me.\n\nARIEL.\nPresently?\n\nPROSPERO.\nAy, with a twink.\n\nARIEL.\nBefore you can say \u201cCome\u201d and \u201cGo,\u201d\nAnd breathe twice, and cry \u201cso, so,\u201d\nEach one, tripping on his toe,\nWill be here with mop and mow.\nDo you love me, master? no?\n\nPROSPERO.\nDearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach\nTill thou dost hear me call.\n\nARIEL.\nWell, I conceive.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPROSPERO.\nLook, thou be true; do not give dalliance\nToo much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw\nTo th\u2019 fire i\u2019 the blood: be more abstemious,\nOr else good night your vow!\n\nFERDINAND.\nI warrant you, sir;\nThe white cold virgin snow upon my heart\nAbates the ardour of my liver.\n\nPROSPERO.\nWell.\nNow come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,\nRather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly.\nNo tongue! all eyes! be silent.\n\n [_Soft music._]\n\n A Masque. Enter Iris.\n\nIRIS.\nCeres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas\nOf wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas;\nThy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\nAnd flat meads thatch\u2019d with stover, them to keep;\nThy banks with pioned and twilled brims,\nWhich spongy April at thy hest betrims,\nTo make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves,\nWhose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,\nBeing lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;\nAnd thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,\nWhere thou thyself dost air: the Queen o\u2019 th\u2019 sky,\nWhose wat\u2019ry arch and messenger am I,\nBids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace,\nHere on this grass-plot, in this very place,\nTo come and sport; her peacocks fly amain:\nApproach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.\n\n Enter Ceres.\n\nCERES.\nHail, many-colour\u2019d messenger, that ne\u2019er\nDost disobey the wife of Jupiter;\nWho with thy saffron wings upon my flowers\nDiffusest honey drops, refreshing showers;\nAnd with each end of thy blue bow dost crown\nMy bosky acres and my unshrubb\u2019d down,\nRich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen\nSummon\u2019d me hither to this short-grass\u2019d green?\n\nIRIS.\nA contract of true love to celebrate,\nAnd some donation freely to estate\nOn the blest lovers.\n\nCERES.\nTell me, heavenly bow,\nIf Venus or her son, as thou dost know,\nDo now attend the queen? Since they did plot\nThe means that dusky Dis my daughter got,\nHer and her blind boy\u2019s scandal\u2019d company\nI have forsworn.\n\nIRIS.\nOf her society\nBe not afraid. I met her deity\nCutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son\nDove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done\nSome wanton charm upon this man and maid,\nWhose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid\nTill Hymen\u2019s torch be lighted; but in vain.\nMars\u2019s hot minion is return\u2019d again;\nHer waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,\nSwears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,\nAnd be a boy right out.\n\nCERES.\nHighest queen of State,\nGreat Juno comes; I know her by her gait.\n\n Enter Juno.\n\nJUNO.\nHow does my bounteous sister? Go with me\nTo bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,\nAnd honour\u2019d in their issue.\n\n [_They sing._]\n\nJUNO.\n_Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,\nLong continuance, and increasing,\nHourly joys be still upon you!\nJuno sings her blessings on you._\n\nCERES.\n_Earth\u2019s increase, foison plenty,\nBarns and gamers never empty;\nVines with clust\u2019ring bunches growing;\nPlants with goodly burden bowing;\nSpring come to you at the farthest\nIn the very end of harvest!\nScarcity and want shall shun you;\nCeres\u2019 blessing so is on you._\n\nFERDINAND.\nThis is a most majestic vision, and\nHarmonious charmingly. May I be bold\nTo think these spirits?\n\nPROSPERO.\nSpirits, which by mine art\nI have from their confines call\u2019d to enact\nMy present fancies.\n\nFERDINAND.\nLet me live here ever.\nSo rare a wonder\u2019d father and a wise,\nMakes this place Paradise.\n\n [_Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment._]\n\nPROSPERO.\nSweet now, silence!\nJuno and Ceres whisper seriously,\nThere\u2019s something else to do: hush, and be mute,\nOr else our spell is marr\u2019d.\n\nIRIS.\nYou nymphs, call\u2019d Naiads, of the windring brooks,\nWith your sedg\u2019d crowns and ever-harmless looks,\nLeave your crisp channels, and on this green land\nAnswer your summons; Juno does command.\nCome, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate\nA contract of true love. Be not too late.\n\n Enter certain Nymphs.\n\nYou sun-burn\u2019d sicklemen, of August weary,\nCome hither from the furrow, and be merry:\nMake holiday: your rye-straw hats put on,\nAnd these fresh nymphs encounter every one\nIn country footing.\n\n Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in\n a graceful dance; towards the end whereof Prospero starts suddenly,\n and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise,\n they heavily vanish.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[_Aside._] I had forgot that foul conspiracy\nOf the beast Caliban and his confederates\nAgainst my life: the minute of their plot\nIs almost come. [_To the Spirits._] Well done! avoid; no\nmore!\n\nFERDINAND.\nThis is strange: your father\u2019s in some passion\nThat works him strongly.\n\nMIRANDA.\nNever till this day\nSaw I him touch\u2019d with anger so distemper\u2019d.\n\nPROSPERO.\nYou do look, my son, in a mov\u2019d sort,\nAs if you were dismay\u2019d: be cheerful, sir:\nOur revels now are ended. These our actors,\nAs I foretold you, were all spirits and\nAre melted into air, into thin air:\nAnd, like the baseless fabric of this vision,\nThe cloud-capp\u2019d towers, the gorgeous palaces,\nThe solemn temples, the great globe itself,\nYea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,\nAnd, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\nLeave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\nAs dreams are made on, and our little life\nIs rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex\u2019d:\nBear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled.\nBe not disturb\u2019d with my infirmity.\nIf you be pleas\u2019d, retire into my cell\nAnd there repose: a turn or two I\u2019ll walk,\nTo still my beating mind.\n\nFERDINAND, MIRANDA.\nWe wish your peace.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nPROSPERO.\nCome, with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel. Come!\n\n Enter Ariel.\n\nARIEL.\nThy thoughts I cleave to. What\u2019s thy pleasure?\n\nPROSPERO.\nSpirit,\nWe must prepare to meet with Caliban.\n\nARIEL.\nAy, my commander. When I presented Ceres,\nI thought to have told thee of it; but I fear\u2019d\nLest I might anger thee.\n\nPROSPERO.\nSay again, where didst thou leave these varlets?\n\nARIEL.\nI told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;\nSo full of valour that they smote the air\nFor breathing in their faces; beat the ground\nFor kissing of their feet; yet always bending\nTowards their project. Then I beat my tabor;\nAt which, like unback\u2019d colts, they prick\u2019d their ears,\nAdvanc\u2019d their eyelids, lifted up their noses\nAs they smelt music: so I charm\u2019d their ears,\nThat calf-like they my lowing follow\u2019d through\nTooth\u2019d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,\nWhich enter\u2019d their frail shins: at last I left them\nI\u2019 th\u2019 filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,\nThere dancing up to th\u2019 chins, that the foul lake\nO\u2019erstunk their feet.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThis was well done, my bird.\nThy shape invisible retain thou still:\nThe trumpery in my house, go bring it hither\nFor stale to catch these thieves.\n\nARIEL.\nI go, I go.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPROSPERO.\nA devil, a born devil, on whose nature\nNurture can never stick; on whom my pains,\nHumanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;\nAnd as with age his body uglier grows,\nSo his mind cankers. I will plague them all,\nEven to roaring.\n\n Re-enter Ariel, loaden with glistering apparel, &c.\n\nCome, hang them on this line.\n\n Prospero and Ariel remain invisible. Enter Caliban, Stephano and\n Trinculo all wet.\n\nCALIBAN.\nPray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not\nHear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMonster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little\nbetter than played the Jack with us.\n\nTRINCULO.\nMonster, I do smell all horse-piss; at which my nose is in great\nindignation.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nSo is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take a displeasure\nagainst you, look you,\u2014\n\nTRINCULO.\nThou wert but a lost monster.\n\nCALIBAN.\nGood my lord, give me thy favour still.\nBe patient, for the prize I\u2019ll bring thee to\nShall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.\nAll\u2019s hush\u2019d as midnight yet.\n\nTRINCULO.\nAy, but to lose our bottles in the pool!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThere is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but an\ninfinite loss.\n\nTRINCULO.\nThat\u2019s more to me than my wetting: yet this is your harmless fairy,\nmonster.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nI will fetch off my bottle, though I be o\u2019er ears for my labour.\n\nCALIBAN.\nPrithee, my King, be quiet. Seest thou here,\nThis is the mouth o\u2019 th\u2019 cell: no noise, and enter.\nDo that good mischief which may make this island\nThine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,\nFor aye thy foot-licker.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nGive me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.\n\nTRINCULO.\nO King Stephano! O peer!

O King Stephano!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nPut off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I\u2019ll have that gown.\n\nTRINCULO.\nThy Grace shall have it.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThe dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean\nTo dote thus on such luggage? Let\u2019t alone,\nAnd do the murder first. If he awake,\nFrom toe to crown he\u2019ll fill our skins with pinches,\nMake us strange stuff.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nBe you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this my jerkin? Now is the\njerkin under the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your hair, and\nprove a bald jerkin.\n\nTRINCULO.\nDo, do: we steal by line and level, an\u2019t like your Grace.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nI thank thee for that jest. Here\u2019s a garment for \u2019t: wit shall not go\nunrewarded while I am King of this country. \u201cSteal by line and level,\u201d\nis an excellent pass of pate.

Go to, carry this.\n\nTRINCULO.\nAnd this.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nAy, and this.\n\n A noise of hunters heard.

Before the cell of Prospero.\n\n Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.\n\nPROSPERO.\nNow does my project gather to a head:\nMy charms crack not; my spirits obey, and time\nGoes upright with his carriage. How\u2019s the day?\n\nARIEL.\nOn the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,\nYou said our work should cease.\n\nPROSPERO.\nI did say so,\nWhen first I rais\u2019d the tempest. Say, my spirit,\nHow fares the King and \u2019s followers?\n\nARIEL.\nConfin\u2019d together\nIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,\nJust as you left them; all prisoners, sir,\nIn the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;\nThey cannot budge till your release. The King,\nHis brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,\nAnd the remainder mourning over them,\nBrimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly\nHim you term\u2019d, sir, \u201cthe good old lord, Gonzalo\u201d.\nHis tears run down his beard, like winter\u2019s drops\nFrom eaves of reeds; your charm so strongly works \u2019em,\nThat if you now beheld them, your affections\nWould become tender.\n\nPROSPERO.\nDost thou think so, spirit?\n\nARIEL.\nMine would, sir, were I human.\n\nPROSPERO.\nAnd mine shall.\nHast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling\nOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,\nOne of their kind, that relish all as sharply\nPassion as they, be kindlier mov\u2019d than thou art?\nThough with their high wrongs I am struck to th\u2019 quick,\nYet with my nobler reason \u2019gainst my fury\nDo I take part: the rarer action is\nIn virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,\nThe sole drift of my purpose doth extend\nNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel.\nMy charms I\u2019ll break, their senses I\u2019ll restore,\nAnd they shall be themselves.\n\nARIEL.\nI\u2019ll fetch them, sir.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPROSPERO.\nYe elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and\ngroves;\nAnd ye that on the sands with printless foot\nDo chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him\nWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets that\nBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\nWhereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime\nIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\nTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,\nWeak masters though ye be, I have bedimm\u2019d\nThe noontide sun, call\u2019d forth the mutinous winds,\nAnd \u2019twixt the green sea and the azur\u2019d vault\nSet roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder\nHave I given fire, and rifted Jove\u2019s stout oak\nWith his own bolt; the strong-bas\u2019d promontory\nHave I made shake, and by the spurs pluck\u2019d up\nThe pine and cedar: graves at my command\nHave wak\u2019d their sleepers, op\u2019d, and let \u2019em forth\nBy my so potent art. But this rough magic\nI here abjure; and, when I have requir\u2019d\nSome heavenly music,\u2014which even now I do,\u2014\nTo work mine end upon their senses that\nThis airy charm is for, I\u2019ll break my staff,\nBury it certain fathoms in the earth,\nAnd deeper than did ever plummet sound\nI\u2019ll drown my book.\n\n [_Solem music._]\n\n Re-enter Ariel: after him, Alonso with a frantic gesture, attended by\n Gonzalo, Sebastian and Antonio in like manner, attended by Adrian and\n Francisco: they all enter the circle which Prospero had made, and\n there stand charmed; which Prospero observing, speaks.\n\nA solemn air, and the best comforter\nTo an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,\nNow useless, boil\u2019d within thy skull! There stand,\nFor you are spell-stopp\u2019d.\nHoly Gonzalo, honourable man,\nMine eyes, e\u2019en sociable to the show of thine,\nFall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace;\nAnd as the morning steals upon the night,\nMelting the darkness, so their rising senses\nBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\nTheir clearer reason. O good Gonzalo!\nMy true preserver, and a loyal sir\nTo him thou follow\u2019st, I will pay thy graces\nHome, both in word and deed. Most cruelly\nDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:\nThy brother was a furtherer in the act.\nThou art pinch\u2019d for \u2019t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,\nYou, brother mine, that entertain\u2019d ambition,\nExpell\u2019d remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian,\u2014\nWhose inward pinches therefore are most strong,\nWould here have kill\u2019d your King; I do forgive thee,\nUnnatural though thou art. Their understanding\nBegins to swell, and the approaching tide\nWill shortly fill the reasonable shores\nThat now lie foul and muddy. Not one of them\nThat yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,\nFetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.\n\n [_Exit Ariel._]\n\nI will discase me, and myself present\nAs I was sometime Milan. Quickly, spirit;\nThou shalt ere long be free.\n\n Ariel re-enters, singing, and helps to attire Prospero.\n\nARIEL\n_Where the bee sucks, there suck I:\nIn a cowslip\u2019s bell I lie;\nThere I couch when owls do cry.\nOn the bat\u2019s back I do fly\nAfter summer merrily.\nMerrily, merrily shall I live now\nUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough._\n\nPROSPERO.\nWhy, that\u2019s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;\nBut yet thou shalt have freedom; so, so, so.\nTo the King\u2019s ship, invisible as thou art:\nThere shalt thou find the mariners asleep\nUnder the hatches; the master and the boatswain\nBeing awake, enforce them to this place,\nAnd presently, I prithee.\n\nARIEL.\nI drink the air before me, and return\nOr ere your pulse twice beat.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nGONZALO.\nAll torment, trouble, wonder and amazement\nInhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us\nOut of this fearful country!\n\nPROSPERO.\nBehold, sir King,\nThe wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.\nFor more assurance that a living prince\nDoes now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;\nAnd to thee and thy company I bid\nA hearty welcome.\n\nALONSO.\nWhe\u2019er thou be\u2019st he or no,\nOr some enchanted trifle to abuse me,\nAs late I have been, I not know: thy pulse\nBeats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,\nTh\u2019 affliction of my mind amends, with which,\nI fear, a madness held me: this must crave,\nAn if this be at all, a most strange story.\nThy dukedom I resign, and do entreat\nThou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero\nBe living and be here?\n\nPROSPERO.\nFirst, noble friend,\nLet me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot\nBe measur\u2019d or confin\u2019d.\n\nGONZALO.\nWhether this be\nOr be not, I\u2019ll not swear.\n\nPROSPERO.\nYou do yet taste\nSome subtleties o\u2019 the isle, that will not let you\nBelieve things certain. Welcome, my friends all.\n[_Aside to Sebastian and Antonio._] But you, my brace of lords, were I\nso minded,\nI here could pluck his highness\u2019 frown upon you,\nAnd justify you traitors: at this time\nI will tell no tales.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\n[_Aside._] The devil speaks in him.\n\nPROSPERO.\nNo.\nFor you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother\nWould even infect my mouth, I do forgive\nThy rankest fault, all of them; and require\nMy dukedom of thee, which perforce I know\nThou must restore.\n\nALONSO.\nIf thou beest Prospero,\nGive us particulars of thy preservation;\nHow thou hast met us here, whom three hours since\nWere wrack\u2019d upon this shore; where I have lost,\u2014\nHow sharp the point of this remembrance is!\u2014\nMy dear son Ferdinand.\n\nPROSPERO.\nI am woe for \u2019t, sir.\n\nALONSO.\nIrreparable is the loss, and patience\nSays it is past her cure.\n\nPROSPERO.\nI rather think\nYou have not sought her help, of whose soft grace,\nFor the like loss I have her sovereign aid,\nAnd rest myself content.\n\nALONSO.\nYou the like loss!\n\nPROSPERO.\nAs great to me, as late; and, supportable\nTo make the dear loss, have I means much weaker\nThan you may call to comfort you, for I\nHave lost my daughter.\n\nALONSO.\nA daughter?\nO heavens, that they were living both in Naples,\nThe King and Queen there! That they were, I wish\nMyself were mudded in that oozy bed\nWhere my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?\n\nPROSPERO.\nIn this last tempest. I perceive, these lords\nAt this encounter do so much admire\nThat they devour their reason, and scarce think\nTheir eyes do offices of truth, their words\nAre natural breath; but, howsoe\u2019er you have\nBeen justled from your senses, know for certain\nThat I am Prospero, and that very duke\nWhich was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely\nUpon this shore, where you were wrack\u2019d, was landed\nTo be the lord on\u2019t. No more yet of this;\nFor \u2019tis a chronicle of day by day,\nNot a relation for a breakfast nor\nBefitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir.\nThis cell\u2019s my court: here have I few attendants,\nAnd subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.\nMy dukedom since you have given me again,\nI will requite you with as good a thing;\nAt least bring forth a wonder, to content ye\nAs much as me my dukedom.\n\nHere Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess.\n\nMIRANDA.\nSweet lord, you play me false.\n\nFERDINAND.\nNo, my dearest love,\nI would not for the world.\n\nMIRANDA.\nYes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,\nAnd I would call it fair play.\n\nALONSO.\nIf this prove\nA vision of the island, one dear son\nShall I twice lose.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nA most high miracle!\n\nFERDINAND.\nThough the seas threaten, they are merciful.\nI have curs\u2019d them without cause.\n\n [_Kneels to Alonso._]\n\nALONSO.\nNow all the blessings\nOf a glad father compass thee about!\nArise, and say how thou cam\u2019st here.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO, wonder!\nHow many goodly creatures are there here!\nHow beauteous mankind is! O brave new world\nThat has such people in \u2019t!\n\nPROSPERO.\n\u2019Tis new to thee.\n\nALONSO.\nWhat is this maid, with whom thou wast at play?\nYour eld\u2019st acquaintance cannot be three hours:\nIs she the goddess that hath sever\u2019d us,\nAnd brought us thus together?\n\nFERDINAND.\nSir, she is mortal;\nBut by immortal Providence she\u2019s mine.\nI chose her when I could not ask my father\nFor his advice, nor thought I had one. She\nIs daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,\nOf whom so often I have heard renown,\nBut never saw before; of whom I have\nReceiv\u2019d a second life; and second father\nThis lady makes him to me.\n\nALONSO.\nI am hers:\nBut, O, how oddly will it sound that I\nMust ask my child forgiveness!\n\nPROSPERO.\nThere, sir, stop:\nLet us not burden our remembrances with\nA heaviness that\u2019s gone.\n\nGONZALO.\nI have inly wept,\nOr should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,\nAnd on this couple drop a blessed crown;\nFor it is you that have chalk\u2019d forth the way\nWhich brought us hither.\n\nALONSO.\nI say, Amen, Gonzalo!\n\nGONZALO.\nWas Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue\nShould become Kings of Naples? O, rejoice\nBeyond a common joy, and set it down\nWith gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage\nDid Claribel her husband find at Tunis,\nAnd Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife\nWhere he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom\nIn a poor isle; and all of us ourselves,\nWhen no man was his own.\n\nALONSO.\n[_To Ferdinand and Miranda._] Give me your hands:\nLet grief and sorrow still embrace his heart\nThat doth not wish you joy!\n\nGONZALO.\nBe it so. Amen!\n\n Re-enter Ariel with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following.\n\nO look, sir, look, sir! Here are more of us.\nI prophesied, if a gallows were on land,\nThis fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,\nThat swear\u2019st grace o\u2019erboard, not an oath on shore?\nHast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nThe best news is that we have safely found\nOur King and company. The next, our ship,\u2014\nWhich but three glasses since, we gave out split,\nIs tight and yare, and bravely rigg\u2019d as when\nWe first put out to sea.\n\nARIEL.\n[_Aside to Prospero._] Sir, all this service\nHave I done since I went.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[_Aside to Ariel._] My tricksy spirit!\n\nALONSO.\nThese are not natural events; they strengthen\nFrom strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nIf I did think, sir, I were well awake,\nI\u2019d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,\nAnd,\u2014how, we know not,\u2014all clapp\u2019d under hatches,\nWhere, but even now, with strange and several noises\nOf roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,\nAnd mo diversity of sounds, all horrible,\nWe were awak\u2019d; straightway, at liberty:\nWhere we, in all her trim, freshly beheld\nOur royal, good, and gallant ship; our master\nCap\u2019ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,\nEven in a dream, were we divided from them,\nAnd were brought moping hither.\n\nARIEL.\n[_Aside to Prospero._] Was\u2019t well done?\n\nPROSPERO.\n[_Aside to Ariel._] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.\n\nALONSO.\nThis is as strange a maze as e\u2019er men trod;\nAnd there is in this business more than nature\nWas ever conduct of: some oracle\nMust rectify our knowledge.\n\nPROSPERO.\nSir, my liege,\nDo not infest your mind with beating on\nThe strangeness of this business. At pick\u2019d leisure,\nWhich shall be shortly, single I\u2019ll resolve you,\nWhich to you shall seem probable, of every\nThese happen\u2019d accidents; till when, be cheerful\nAnd think of each thing well. [_Aside to Ariel._] Come hither, spirit;\nSet Caliban and his companions free;\nUntie the spell.\n\n [_Exit Ariel._]\n\n How fares my gracious sir?\nThere are yet missing of your company\nSome few odd lads that you remember not.\n\n Re-enter Ariel driving in Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo in their\n stolen apparel.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nEvery man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself,\nfor all is but fortune.\u2014Coragio! bully-monster, coragio!\n\nTRINCULO.\nIf these be true spies which I wear in my head, here\u2019s a goodly sight.\n\nCALIBAN.\nO Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed.\nHow fine my master is! I am afraid\nHe will chastise me.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHa, ha!\nWhat things are these, my lord Antonio?\nWill money buy them?\n\nANTONIO.\nVery like; one of them\nIs a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.\n\nPROSPERO.\nMark but the badges of these men, my lords,\nThen say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,\nHis mother was a witch; and one so strong\nThat could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,\nAnd deal in her command without her power.\nThese three have robb\u2019d me; and this demi-devil,\nFor he\u2019s a bastard one, had plotted with them\nTo take my life. Two of these fellows you\nMust know and own; this thing of darkness I\nAcknowledge mine.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI shall be pinch\u2019d to death.\n\nALONSO.\nIs not this Stephano, my drunken butler?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHe is drunk now: where had he wine?\n\nALONSO.\nAnd Trinculo is reeling-ripe: where should they\nFind this grand liquor that hath gilded \u2019em?\nHow cam\u2019st thou in this pickle?\n\nTRINCULO.\nI have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will\nnever out of my bones. I shall not fear fly-blowing.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhy, how now, Stephano!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nO! touch me not. I am not Stephano, but a cramp.\n\nPROSPERO.\nYou\u2019d be King o\u2019 the isle, sirrah?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nI should have been a sore one, then.\n\nALONSO.\nThis is as strange a thing as e\u2019er I look\u2019d on.\n\n [_Pointing to Caliban._]\n\nPROSPERO.\nHe is as disproportioned in his manners\nAs in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;\nTake with you your companions. As you look\nTo have my pardon, trim it handsomely.\n\nCALIBAN.\nAy, that I will; and I\u2019ll be wise hereafter,\nAnd seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass\nWas I, to take this drunkard for a god,\nAnd worship this dull fool!\n\nPROSPERO.\nGo to; away!\n\nALONSO.\nHence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nOr stole it, rather.\n\n [_Exeunt Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo._]\n\nPROSPERO.\nSir, I invite your Highness and your train\nTo my poor cell, where you shall take your rest\nFor this one night; which, part of it, I\u2019ll waste\nWith such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it\nGo quick away: the story of my life\nAnd the particular accidents gone by\nSince I came to this isle: and in the morn\nI\u2019ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,\nWhere I have hope to see the nuptial\nOf these our dear-belov\u2019d solemnized;\nAnd thence retire me to my Milan, where\nEvery third thought shall be my grave.\n\nALONSO.\nI long\nTo hear the story of your life, which must\nTake the ear strangely.\n\nPROSPERO.\nI\u2019ll deliver all;\nAnd promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,\nAnd sail so expeditious that shall catch\nYour royal fleet far off. [_Aside to Ariel._] My Ariel,\nchick,\nThat is thy charge: then to the elements\nBe free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nPROSPERO.\nNow my charms are all o\u2019erthrown,\nAnd what strength I have\u2019s mine own,\nWhich is most faint. Now \u2019tis true,\nI must be here confin\u2019d by you,\nOr sent to Naples. Let me not,\nSince I have my dukedom got,\nAnd pardon\u2019d the deceiver, dwell\nIn this bare island by your spell,\nBut release me from my bands\nWith the help of your good hands.\nGentle breath of yours my sails\nMust fill, or else my project fails,\nWhich was to please. Now I want\nSpirits to enforce, art to enchant;\nAnd my ending is despair,\nUnless I be reliev\u2019d by prayer,\nWhich pierces so that it assaults\nMercy itself, and frees all faults.\n    As you from crimes would pardon\u2019d be,\n    Let your indulgence set me free.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\n\n"
