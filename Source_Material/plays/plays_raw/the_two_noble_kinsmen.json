This is the feare we bring;\r\nFor to say Truth, it were an endlesse thing,\r\nAnd too ambitious, to aspire to him,\r\nWeake as we are, and almost breathlesse swim\r\nIn this deepe water.  Do but you hold out\r\nYour helping hands, and we shall take about,\r\nAnd something doe to save us: You shall heare\r\nSceanes, though below his Art, may yet appeare\r\nWorth two houres travell.

O, if thou couch\r\nBut one night with her, every howre in't will\r\nTake hostage of thee for a hundred, and\r\nThou shalt remember nothing more then what\r\nThat Banket bids thee too.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLITA.\r\nThough much unlike  [Kneeling.]\r\nYou should be so transported, as much sorry\r\nI should be such a Suitour; yet I thinke,\r\nDid I not by th'abstayning of my joy,\r\nWhich breeds a deeper longing, cure their surfeit\r\nThat craves a present medcine, I should plucke\r\nAll Ladies scandall on me.  Therefore, Sir,\r\nAs I shall here make tryall of my prayres,\r\nEither presuming them to have some force,\r\nOr sentencing for ay their vigour dombe:\r\nProrogue this busines we are going about, and hang\r\nYour Sheild afore your Heart, about that necke\r\nWhich is my ffee, and which I freely lend\r\nTo doe these poore Queenes service.\r\n\r\nALL QUEENS.\r\nOh helpe now,\r\nOur Cause cries for your knee.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIf you grant not  [Kneeling.]\r\nMy Sister her petition in that force,\r\nWith that Celerity and nature, which\r\nShee makes it in, from henceforth ile not dare\r\nTo aske you any thing, nor be so hardy\r\nEver to take a Husband.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nPray stand up.\r\nI am entreating of my selfe to doe\r\nThat which you kneele to have me.  Pyrithous,\r\nLeade on the Bride; get you and pray the Gods\r\nFor successe, and returne; omit not any thing\r\nIn the pretended Celebration.  Queenes,\r\nFollow your Soldier.  As before, hence you  [to Artesius]\r\nAnd at the banckes of Aulis meete us with\r\nThe forces you can raise, where we shall finde\r\nThe moytie of a number, for a busines\r\nMore bigger look't.

I thinke\r\nTheseus cannot be umpire to himselfe,\r\nCleaving his conscience into twaine and doing\r\nEach side like Iustice, which he loves best.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nDoubtlesse\r\nThere is a best, and reason has no manners\r\nTo say it is not you: I was acquainted\r\nOnce with a time, when I enjoyd a Play-fellow;\r\nYou were at wars, when she the grave enrichd,\r\nWho made too proud the Bed, tooke leave o th Moone\r\n(Which then lookt pale at parting) when our count\r\nWas each eleven.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLITA.\r\nTwas Flaui(n)a.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nYes.\r\nYou talke of Pirithous and Theseus love;\r\nTheirs has more ground, is more maturely seasond,\r\nMore buckled with strong Iudgement and their needes\r\nThe one of th'other may be said to water  [2.

This rehearsall\r\n(Which ev'ry innocent wots well comes in\r\nLike old importments bastard) has this end,\r\nThat the true love tweene Mayde, and mayde, may be\r\nMore then in sex idividuall.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLITA.\r\nY'are out of breath\r\nAnd this high speeded pace, is but to say\r\nThat you shall never like the Maide Flavina\r\nLove any that's calld Man.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI am sure I shall not.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLITA.\r\nNow, alacke, weake Sister,\r\nI must no more beleeve thee in this point\r\n(Though in't I know thou dost beleeve thy selfe,)\r\nThen I will trust a sickely appetite,\r\nThat loathes even as it longs; but, sure, my Sister,\r\nIf I were ripe for your perswasion, you\r\nHave saide enough to shake me from the Arme\r\nOf the all noble Theseus, for whose fortunes\r\nI will now in, and kneele with great assurance,\r\nThat we, more then his Pirothous, possesse\r\nThe high throne in his heart.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI am not\r\nAgainst your faith; yet I continew mine.

As I late was angling\r\nIn the great Lake that lies behind the Pallace,\r\nFrom the far shore, thicke set with reedes and Sedges,\r\nAs patiently I was attending sport,\r\nI heard a voyce, a shrill one, and attentive\r\nI gave my eare, when I might well perceive\r\nT'was one that sung, and by the smallnesse of it\r\nA boy or woman.  I then left my angle\r\nTo his owne skill, came neere, but yet perceivd not\r\nWho made the sound, the rushes and the Reeds\r\nHad so encompast it: I laide me downe\r\nAnd listned to the words she sung, for then,\r\nThrough a small glade cut by the Fisher men,\r\nI saw it was your Daughter.\r\n\r\nIAILOR.\r\nPray, goe on, Sir?\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nShe sung much, but no sence; onely I heard her\r\nRepeat this often: 'Palamon is gone,\r\nIs gone to'th wood to gather Mulberies;\r\nIle finde him out to morrow.'\r\n\r\n1.

Then she talk'd of you, Sir;\r\nThat you must loose your head to morrow morning,\r\nAnd she must gather flowers to bury you,\r\nAnd see the house made handsome: then she sung\r\nNothing but 'Willow, willow, willow,' and betweene\r\nEver was, 'Palamon, faire Palamon,'\r\nAnd 'Palamon was a tall yong man.'  The place\r\nWas knee deepe where she sat; her careles Tresses\r\nA wreathe of bull-rush rounded; about her stucke\r\nThousand fresh water flowers of severall cullors,\r\nThat me thought she appeard like the faire Nimph\r\nThat feedes the lake with waters, or as Iris\r\nNewly dropt downe from heaven; Rings she made\r\nOf rushes that grew by, and to 'em spoke\r\nThe prettiest posies: 'Thus our true love's tide,'\r\n'This you may loose, not me,' and many a one:\r\nAnd then she wept, and sung againe, and sigh'd,\r\nAnd with the same breath smil'd, and kist her hand.\r\n\r\n2.

It is a\r\nfalsehood she is in, which is with falsehood to be combated. This may\r\nbring her to eate, to sleepe, and reduce what's now out of square in\r\nher, into their former law, and regiment; I have seene it approved, how\r\nmany times I know not, but to make the number more, I have great hope\r\nin this.

[Another cry, and showt within, and\r\n Cornets.]  This burst of clamour\r\nIs sure th'end o'th Combat.\r\n\r\n[Enter Servant.]\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThey saide that Palamon had Arcites body\r\nWithin an inch o'th Pyramid, that the cry\r\nWas generall 'a Palamon': But, anon,\r\nTh'Assistants made a brave redemption, and\r\nThe two bold Tytlers, at this instant are\r\nHand to hand at it.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWere they metamorphisd\r\nBoth into one! oh why? there were no woman\r\nWorth so composd a Man: their single share,\r\nTheir noblenes peculier to them, gives\r\nThe prejudice of disparity, values shortnes,  [Cornets.  Cry within,\r\n Arcite, Arcite.]\r\nTo any Lady breathing\u2014More exulting?\r\nPalamon still?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nNay, now the sound is Arcite.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI pre'thee, lay attention to the Cry,  [Cornets.  A great showt and\r\ncry, 'Arcite, victory!'] Set both thine eares to'th busines.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThe cry is\r\n'Arcite', and 'victory', harke: 'Arcite, victory!'\r\nThe Combats consummation is proclaim'd\r\nBy the wind Instruments.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHalfe sights saw\r\nThat Arcite was no babe; god's lyd, his richnes\r\nAnd costlines of spirit look't through him, it could\r\nNo more be hid in him then fire in flax,\r\nThen humble banckes can goe to law with waters,\r\nThat drift windes force to raging: I did thinke\r\nGood Palamon would miscarry; yet I knew not\r\nWhy I did thinke so; Our reasons are not prophets,\r\nWhen oft our fancies are.  They are comming off:\r\nAlas, poore Palamon!  [Cornets.]\r\n\r\n[Enter Theseus, Hipolita, Pirithous, Arcite as victor, and\r\n attendants, &c.]\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nLo, where our Sister is in expectation,\r\nYet quaking, and unsetled.\u2014Fairest Emily,\r\nThe gods by their divine arbitrament\r\nHave given you this Knight; he is a good one\r\nAs ever strooke at head.  Give me your hands;\r\nReceive you her, you him; be plighted with\r\nA love that growes, as you decay.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nEmily,\r\nTo buy you, I have lost what's deerest to me,\r\nSave what is bought, and yet I purchase cheapely,\r\nAs I doe rate your value.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nO loved Sister,\r\nHe speakes now of as brave a Knight as ere\r\nDid spur a noble Steed: Surely, the gods\r\nWould have him die a Batchelour, least his race\r\nShould shew i'th world too godlike: His behaviour\r\nSo charmed me, that me thought Alcides was\r\nTo him a sow of lead: if I could praise\r\nEach part of him to'th all I have spoke, your Arcite\r\nDid not loose by't; For he that was thus good\r\nEncountred yet his Better.  I have heard\r\nTwo emulous Philomels beate the eare o'th night\r\nWith their contentious throates, now one the higher,\r\nAnon the other, then againe the first,\r\nAnd by and by out breasted, that the sence\r\nCould not be judge betweene 'em: So it far'd\r\nGood space betweene these kinesmen; till heavens did\r\nMake hardly one the winner.  Weare the Girlond\r\nWith joy that you have won: For the subdude,\r\nGive them our present Iustice, since I know\r\nTheir lives but pinch 'em; Let it here be done.\r\nThe Sceane's not for our seeing, goe we hence,\r\nRight joyfull, with some sorrow.\u2014Arme your prize,\r\nI know you will not loose her.\u2014Hipolita,\r\nI see one eye of yours conceives a teare\r\nThe which it will deliver.  [Florish.]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIs this wynning?\r\nOh all you heavenly powers, where is your mercy?\r\nBut that your wils have saide it must be so,\r\nAnd charge me live to comfort this unfriended,\r\nThis miserable Prince, that cuts away\r\nA life more worthy from him then all women,\r\nI should, and would, die too.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLITA.\r\nInfinite pitty,\r\nThat fowre such eies should be so fixd on one\r\nThat two must needes be blinde fort.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nSo it is.  [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nSCENE 4.  (The same; a Block prepared.)\r\n\r\n[Enter Palamon and his Knightes pyniond: Iaylor, Executioner, &c. \r\nGard.]\r\n\r\n(PALAMON.)\r\nTher's many a man alive that hath out liv'd\r\nThe love o'th people; yea, i'th selfesame state\r\nStands many a Father with his childe; some comfort\r\nWe have by so considering: we expire\r\nAnd not without mens pitty.  To live still,\r\nHave their good wishes; we prevent\r\nThe loathsome misery of age, beguile\r\nThe Gowt and Rheume, that in lag howres attend\r\nFor grey approachers; we come towards the gods\r\nYong and unwapper'd, not halting under Crymes\r\nMany and stale: that sure shall please the gods,\r\nSooner than such, to give us Nectar with 'em,\r\nFor we are more cleare Spirits.  My deare kinesmen,\r\nWhose lives (for this poore comfort) are laid downe,\r\nYou have sould 'em too too cheape.\r\n\r\n1. KNIGHT.\r\nWhat ending could be\r\nOf more content? ore us the victors have\r\nFortune, whose title is as momentary,\r\nAs to us death is certaine: A graine of honour\r\nThey not ore'-weigh us.\r\n\r\n2. KNIGHT.\r\nLet us bid farewell;\r\nAnd with our patience anger tottring Fortune,\r\nWho at her certain'st reeles.\r\n\r\n3. KNIGHT.\r\nCome; who begins?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nEv'n he that led you to this Banket shall\r\nTaste to you all.\u2014Ah ha, my Friend, my Friend,\r\nYour gentle daughter gave me freedome once;\r\nYou'l see't done now for ever: pray, how do'es she?\r\nI heard she was not well; her kind of ill\r\nGave me some sorrow.\r\n\r\nIAILOR.\r\nSir, she's well restor'd,\r\nAnd to be marryed shortly.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nBy my short life,\r\nI am most glad on't; Tis the latest thing\r\nI shall be glad of; pre'thee tell her so:\r\nCommend me to her, and to peece her portion,\r\nTender her this.  [Gives purse.]\r\n\r\n1. KNIGHT.\r\nNay lets be offerers all.\r\n\r\n2. KNIGHT.\r\nIs it a maide?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nVerily, I thinke so,\r\nA right good creature, more to me deserving\r\nThen I can quight or speake of.\r\n\r\nALL KNIGHTS.\r\nCommend us to her.  [They give their purses.]\r\n\r\nIAILOR.\r\nThe gods requight you all,\r\nAnd make her thankefull.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nAdiew; and let my life be now as short,\r\nAs my leave taking.  [Lies on the Blocke.]\r\n\r\n1. KNIGHT.\r\nLeade, couragious Cosin.\r\n\r\n2. KNIGHT.\r\nWee'l follow cheerefully.  [A great noise within crying, 'run, save,\r\nhold!']\r\n\r\n[Enter in hast a Messenger.]\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nHold, hold!  O hold, hold, hold!\r\n\r\n[Enter Pirithous in haste.]\r\n\r\nPERITHOUS.\r\nHold! hoa!  It is a cursed hast you made,\r\nIf you have done so quickly.  Noble Palamon,\r\nThe gods will shew their glory in a life,\r\nThat thou art yet to leade.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nCan that be,\r\nWhen Venus, I have said, is false?  How doe things fare?\r\n\r\nPERITHOUS.\r\nArise, great Sir, and give the tydings eare\r\nThat are most dearly sweet and bitter.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nWhat\r\nHath wakt us from our dreame?\r\n\r\nPERITHOUS.\r\nList then: your Cosen,\r\nMounted upon a Steed that Emily\r\nDid first bestow on him, a blacke one, owing\r\nNot a hayre worth of white\u2014which some will say\r\nWeakens his price, and many will not buy\r\nHis goodnesse with this note: Which superstition\r\nHeere findes allowance\u2014On this horse is Arcite\r\nTrotting the stones of Athens, which the Calkins\r\nDid rather tell then trample; for the horse\r\nWould make his length a mile, if't pleas'd his Rider\r\nTo put pride in him: as he thus went counting\r\nThe flinty pavement, dancing, as t'wer, to'th Musicke\r\nHis owne hoofes made; (for as they say from iron\r\nCame Musickes origen) what envious Flint,\r\nCold as old Saturne, and like him possest\r\nWith fire malevolent, darted a Sparke,\r\nOr what feirce sulphur else, to this end made,\r\nI comment not;\u2014the hot horse, hot as fire,\r\nTooke Toy at this, and fell to what disorder\r\nHis power could give his will; bounds, comes on end,\r\nForgets schoole dooing, being therein traind,\r\nAnd of kind mannadge; pig-like he whines\r\nAt the sharpe Rowell, which he freats at rather\r\nThen any jot obaies; seekes all foule meanes\r\nOf boystrous and rough Iadrie, to dis-seate\r\nHis Lord, that kept it bravely: when nought serv'd,\r\nWhen neither Curb would cracke, girth breake nor diffring plunges\r\nDis-roote his Rider whence he grew, but that\r\nHe kept him tweene his legges, on his hind hoofes on end he stands,\r\nThat Arcites leggs, being higher then his head,\r\nSeem'd with strange art to hand: His victors wreath\r\nEven then fell off his head: and presently\r\nBackeward the Iade comes ore, and his full poyze\r\nBecomes the Riders loade: yet is he living,\r\nBut such a vessell tis, that floates but for\r\nThe surge that next approaches: he much desires\r\nTo have some speech with you: Loe he appeares.\r\n\r\n[Enter Theseus, Hipolita, Emilia, Arcite in a chaire.]\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nO miserable end of our alliance!\r\nThe gods are mightie, Arcite: if thy heart,\r\nThy worthie, manly heart, be yet unbroken,\r\nGive me thy last words; I am Palamon,\r\nOne that yet loves thee dying.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nTake Emilia\r\nAnd with her all the worlds joy: Reach thy hand:\r\nFarewell: I have told my last houre.  I was false,\r\nYet never treacherous: Forgive me, Cosen:\u2014\r\nOne kisse from faire Emilia: Tis done:\r\nTake her: I die.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThy brave soule seeke Elizium.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIle close thine eyes, Prince; blessed soules be with thee!\r\nThou art a right good man, and while I live,\r\nThis day I give to teares.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nAnd I to honour.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nIn this place first you fought: ev'n very here\r\nI sundred you: acknowledge to the gods\r\nOur thankes that you are living.\r\nHis part is playd, and though it were too short,\r\nHe did it well: your day is lengthned, and\r\nThe blissefull dew of heaven do's arowze you.\r\nThe powerfull Venus well hath grac'd her Altar,\r\nAnd given you your love: Our Master Mars\r\nHath vouch'd his Oracle, and to Arcite gave\r\nThe grace of the Contention: So the Deities\r\nHave shewd due justice: Beare this hence.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nO Cosen,\r\nThat we should things desire, which doe cost us\r\nThe losse of our desire!  That nought could buy\r\nDeare love, but losse of deare love!\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nNever Fortune\r\nDid play a subtler Game: The conquerd triumphes,\r\nThe victor has the Losse: yet in the passage\r\nThe gods have beene most equall: Palamon,\r\nYour kinseman hath confest the right o'th Lady\r\nDid lye in you, for you first saw her, and\r\nEven then proclaimd your fancie: He restord her\r\nAs your stolne Iewell, and desir'd your spirit\r\nTo send him hence forgiven; The gods my justice\r\nTake from my hand, and they themselves become\r\nThe Executioners: Leade your Lady off;\r\nAnd call your Lovers from the stage of death,\r\nWhom I adopt my Frinds.  A day or two\r\nLet us looke sadly, and give grace unto\r\nThe Funerall of Arcite; in whose end\r\nThe visages of Bridegroomes weele put on\r\nAnd smile with Palamon; for whom an houre,\r\nBut one houre, since, I was as dearely sorry,\r\nAs glad of Arcite: and am now as glad,\r\nAs for him sorry.  O you heavenly Charmers,\r\nWhat things you make of us!  For what we lacke\r\nWe laugh, for what we have, are sorry: still\r\nAre children in some kind.  Let us be thankefull\r\nFor that which is, and with you leave dispute\r\nThat are above our question.  Let's goe off,\r\nAnd beare us like the time.  [Florish.  Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\nI would now aske ye how ye like the Play,\r\nBut, as it is with Schoole Boyes, cannot say,\r\nI am cruell fearefull: pray, yet stay a while,\r\nAnd let me looke upon ye: No man smile?\r\nThen it goes hard, I see; He that has\r\nLov'd a yong hansome wench, then, show his face\u2014\r\nTis strange if none be heere\u2014and if he will\r\nAgainst his Conscience, let him hisse, and kill\r\nOur Market: Tis in vaine, I see, to stay yee;\r\nHave at the worst can come, then!  Now what say ye?\r\nAnd yet mistake me not: I am not bold;\r\nWe have no such cause.  If the tale we have told\r\n(For tis no other) any way content ye\r\n(For to that honest purpose it was ment ye)\r\nWe have our end; and ye shall have ere long,\r\nI dare say, many a better, to prolong\r\nYour old loves to us: we, and all our might\r\nRest at your service.  Gentlemen, good night.  [Florish.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r"
