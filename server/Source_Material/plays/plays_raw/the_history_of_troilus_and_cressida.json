From isles of Greece\nThe princes orgulous, their high blood chaf\u2019d,\nHave to the port of Athens sent their ships\nFraught with the ministers and instruments\nOf cruel war. Sixty and nine that wore\nTheir crownets regal from the Athenian bay\nPut forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made\nTo ransack Troy, within whose strong immures\nThe ravish\u2019d Helen, Menelaus\u2019 queen,\nWith wanton Paris sleeps\u2014and that\u2019s the quarrel.\nTo Tenedos they come,\nAnd the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge\nTheir war-like fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains\nThe fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch\nTheir brave pavilions: Priam\u2019s six-gated city,\nDardan, and Tymbria, Ilias, Chetas, Troien,\nAnd Antenorides, with massy staples\nAnd corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,\nStir up the sons of Troy.\nNow expectation, tickling skittish spirits\nOn one and other side, Trojan and Greek,\nSets all on hazard. And hither am I come\nA prologue arm\u2019d, but not in confidence\nOf author\u2019s pen or actor\u2019s voice, but suited\nIn like conditions as our argument,\nTo tell you, fair beholders, that our play\nLeaps o\u2019er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,\nBeginning in the middle; starting thence away,\nTo what may be digested in a play.\nLike or find fault; do as your pleasures are;\nNow good or bad, \u2019tis but the chance of war.\n\n\n\nACT I.\n\nSCENE I. Troy. Before PRIAM\u2019S palace.\n\n Enter Troilus armed, and Pandarus.\n\nTROILUS.\nCall here my varlet; I\u2019ll unarm again.\nWhy should I war without the walls of Troy\nThat find such cruel battle here within?\nEach Trojan that is master of his heart,\nLet him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWill this gear ne\u2019er be mended?\n\nTROILUS.\nThe Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,\nFierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;\nBut I am weaker than a woman\u2019s tear,\nTamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,\nLess valiant than the virgin in the night,\nAnd skilless as unpractis\u2019d infancy.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell, I have told you enough of this; for my part, I\u2019ll not meddle nor\nmake no farther. He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry\nthe grinding.\n\nTROILUS.\nHave I not tarried?\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.\n\nTROILUS.\nHave I not tarried?\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.\n\nTROILUS.\nStill have I tarried.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, to the leavening; but here\u2019s yet in the word \u2018hereafter\u2019 the\nkneading, the making of the cake, the heating of the oven, and the\nbaking; nay, you must stay the cooling too, or you may chance burn your\nlips.\n\nTROILUS.\nPatience herself, what goddess e\u2019er she be,\nDoth lesser blench at suff\u2019rance than I do.\nAt Priam\u2019s royal table do I sit;\nAnd when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,\nSo, traitor! \u2018when she comes\u2019! when she is thence?\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell, she look\u2019d yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look, or any\nwoman else.\n\nTROILUS.\nI was about to tell thee: when my heart,\nAs wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,\nLest Hector or my father should perceive me,\nI have, as when the sun doth light a storm,\nBuried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.\nBut sorrow that is couch\u2019d in seeming gladness\nIs like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAn her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen\u2019s, well, go to, there\nwere no more comparison between the women. But, for my part, she is my\nkinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise her, but I would\nsomebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I will not dispraise\nyour sister Cassandra\u2019s wit; but\u2014\n\nTROILUS.\nO Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,\nWhen I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown\u2019d,\nReply not in how many fathoms deep\nThey lie indrench\u2019d. I tell thee I am mad\nIn Cressid\u2019s love. Thou answer\u2019st \u2018She is fair\u2019;\nPour\u2019st in the open ulcer of my heart\nHer eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,\nHandlest in thy discourse. O! that her hand,\nIn whose comparison all whites are ink\nWriting their own reproach; to whose soft seizure\nThe cygnet\u2019s down is harsh, and spirit of sense\nHard as the palm of ploughman! This thou tell\u2019st me,\nAs true thou tell\u2019st me, when I say I love her;\nBut, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,\nThou lay\u2019st in every gash that love hath given me\nThe knife that made it.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI speak no more than truth.\n\nTROILUS.\nThou dost not speak so much.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFaith, I\u2019ll not meddle in\u2019t. Let her be as she is: if she be fair, \u2019tis\nthe better for her; and she be not, she has the mends in her own hands.\n\nTROILUS.\nGood Pandarus! How now, Pandarus!\n\nPANDARUS.\nI have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of her and ill\nthought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my\nlabour.\n\nTROILUS.\nWhat! art thou angry, Pandarus? What! with me?\n\nPANDARUS.\nBecause she\u2019s kin to me, therefore she\u2019s not so fair as Helen. And she\nwere not kin to me, she would be as fair on Friday as Helen is on\nSunday. But what care I? I care not and she were a blackamoor; \u2019tis all\none to me.\n\nTROILUS.\nSay I she is not fair?\n\nPANDARUS.\nI do not care whether you do or no. She\u2019s a fool to stay behind her\nfather. Let her to the Greeks; and so I\u2019ll tell her the next time I see\nher. For my part, I\u2019ll meddle nor make no more i\u2019 the matter.\n\nTROILUS.\nPandarus\u2014\n\nPANDARUS.\nNot I.\n\nTROILUS.\nSweet Pandarus\u2014\n\nPANDARUS.\nPray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I found it, and\nthere an end.\n\n [_Exit Pandarus. An alarum._]\n\nTROILUS.\nPeace, you ungracious clamours! Peace, rude sounds!\nFools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,\nWhen with your blood you daily paint her thus.\nI cannot fight upon this argument;\nIt is too starv\u2019d a subject for my sword.\nBut Pandarus, O gods! how do you plague me!\nI cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;\nAnd he\u2019s as tetchy to be woo\u2019d to woo\nAs she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.\nTell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne\u2019s love,\nWhat Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?\nHer bed is India; there she lies, a pearl;\nBetween our Ilium and where she resides\nLet it be call\u2019d the wild and wandering flood;\nOurself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar\nOur doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.\n\n Alarum. Enter Aeneas.\n\nAENEAS.\nHow now, Prince Troilus! Wherefore not afield?\n\nTROILUS.\nBecause not there. This woman\u2019s answer sorts,\nFor womanish it is to be from thence.\nWhat news, Aeneas, from the field today?\n\nAENEAS.\nThat Paris is returned home, and hurt.\n\nTROILUS.\nBy whom, Aeneas?\n\nAENEAS.\nTroilus, by Menelaus.\n\nTROILUS.\nLet Paris bleed: \u2019tis but a scar to scorn;\nParis is gor\u2019d with Menelaus\u2019 horn.\n\n [_Alarum._]\n\nAENEAS.\nHark what good sport is out of town today!\n\nTROILUS.\nBetter at home, if \u2018would I might\u2019 were \u2018may.\u2019\nBut to the sport abroad. Are you bound thither?\n\nAENEAS.\nIn all swift haste.\n\nTROILUS.\nCome, go we then together.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Troy. A street.\n\n Enter Cressida and her man Alexander.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWho were those went by?\n\nALEXANDER.\nQueen Hecuba and Helen.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAnd whither go they?\n\nALEXANDER.\nUp to the eastern tower,\nWhose height commands as subject all the vale,\nTo see the battle. Hector, whose patience\nIs as a virtue fix\u2019d, today was mov\u2019d.\nHe chid Andromache, and struck his armourer;\nAnd, like as there were husbandry in war,\nBefore the sun rose he was harness\u2019d light,\nAnd to the field goes he; where every flower\nDid as a prophet weep what it foresaw\nIn Hector\u2019s wrath.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhat was his cause of anger?\n\nALEXANDER.\nThe noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks\nA lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;\nThey call him Ajax.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nGood; and what of him?\n\nALEXANDER.\nThey say he is a very man _per se_\nAnd stands alone.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSo do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.\n\nALEXANDER.\nThis man, lady, hath robb\u2019d many beasts of their particular additions:\nhe is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the\nelephant\u2014a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour\nis crush\u2019d into folly, his folly sauced with discretion. There is no\nman hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint\nbut he carries some stain of it; he is melancholy without cause and\nmerry against the hair; he hath the joints of everything; but\neverything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and\nno use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBut how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector angry?\n\nALEXANDER.\nThey say he yesterday cop\u2019d Hector in the battle and struck him down,\nthe disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and\nwaking.\n\n Enter Pandarus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWho comes here?\n\nALEXANDER.\nMadam, your uncle Pandarus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHector\u2019s a gallant man.\n\nALEXANDER.\nAs may be in the world, lady.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat\u2019s that? What\u2019s that?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nGood morrow, uncle Pandarus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nGood morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?\u2014Good morrow,\nAlexander.\u2014How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThis morning, uncle.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm\u2019d and gone ere you\ncame to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHector was gone; but Helen was not up.\n\nPANDARUS.\nE\u2019en so. Hector was stirring early.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThat were we talking of, and of his anger.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWas he angry?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSo he says here.\n\nPANDARUS.\nTrue, he was so; I know the cause too; he\u2019ll lay about him today, I can\ntell them that. And there\u2019s Troilus will not come far behind him; let\nthem take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhat, is he angry too?\n\nPANDARUS.\nWho, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO Jupiter! there\u2019s no comparison.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man if you see him?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAy, if I ever saw him before and knew him.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell, I say Troilus is Troilus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThen you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNo, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.\n\nCRESSIDA.\n\u2019Tis just to each of them: he is himself.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHimself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSo he is.\n\nPANDARUS.\nCondition I had gone barefoot to India.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHe is not Hector.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHimself! no, he\u2019s not himself. Would a\u2019 were himself! Well, the gods\nare above; time must friend or end. Well, Troilus, well! I would my\nheart were in her body! No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nExcuse me.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHe is elder.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nPardon me, pardon me.\n\nPANDARUS.\nTh\u2019other\u2019s not come to\u2019t; you shall tell me another tale when\nth\u2019other\u2019s come to\u2019t. Hector shall not have his wit this year.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHe shall not need it if he have his own.\n\nANDARUS.\nNor his qualities.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNo matter.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNor his beauty.\n\nCRESSIDA.\n\u2019Twould not become him: his own\u2019s better.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou have no judgement, niece. Helen herself swore th\u2019other day that\nTroilus, for a brown favour, for so \u2019tis, I must confess\u2014not brown\nneither\u2014\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNo, but brown.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFaith, to say truth, brown and not brown.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nTo say the truth, true and not true.\n\nPANDARUS.\nShe prais\u2019d his complexion above Paris.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhy, Paris hath colour enough.\n\nPANDARUS.\nSo he has.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThen Troilus should have too much. If she prais\u2019d him above, his\ncomplexion is higher than his; he having colour enough, and the other\nhigher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as lief\nHelen\u2019s golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThen she\u2019s a merry Greek indeed.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNay, I am sure she does. She came to him th\u2019other day into the\ncompass\u2019d window\u2014and you know he has not past three or four hairs on\nhis chin\u2014\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIndeed a tapster\u2019s arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to\na total.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhy, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound lift as much\nas his brother Hector.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIs he so young a man and so old a lifter?\n\nPANDARUS.\nBut to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and puts me her\nwhite hand to his cloven chin\u2014\n\nCRESSIDA.\nJuno have mercy! How came it cloven?\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhy, you know, \u2019tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes him better\nthan any man in all Phrygia.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO, he smiles valiantly!\n\nPANDARUS.\nDoes he not?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO yes, an \u2019twere a cloud in autumn!\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhy, go to, then! But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus\u2014\n\nCRESSIDA.\nTroilus will stand to the proof, if you\u2019ll prove it so.\n\nPANDARUS.\nTroilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIf you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head, you would\neat chickens i\u2019 th\u2019 shell.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin. Indeed,\nshe has a marvell\u2019s white hand, I must needs confess.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWithout the rack.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAnd she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAlas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.\n\nPANDARUS.\nBut there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh\u2019d that her eyes ran\no\u2019er.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWith millstones.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAnd Cassandra laugh\u2019d.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBut there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes. Did her\neyes run o\u2019er too?\n\nPANDARUS.\nAnd Hector laugh\u2019d.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAt what was all this laughing?\n\nPANDARUS.\nMarry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus\u2019 chin.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAnd\u2019t had been a green hair I should have laugh\u2019d too.\n\nPANDARUS.\nThey laugh\u2019d not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhat was his answer?\n\nPANDARUS.\nQuoth she \u2018Here\u2019s but two and fifty hairs on your chin, and one of them\nis white.\u2019\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThis is her question.\n\nPANDARUS.\nThat\u2019s true; make no question of that. \u2018Two and fifty hairs,\u2019 quoth he\n\u2018and one white. That white hair is my father, and all the rest are his\nsons.\u2019 \u2018Jupiter!\u2019 quoth she \u2018which of these hairs is Paris my husband?\u2019\n\u2018The forked one,\u2019 quoth he, \u2019pluck\u2019t out and give it him.\u2019 But there\nwas such laughing! and Helen so blush\u2019d, and Paris so chaf\u2019d; and all\nthe rest so laugh\u2019d that it pass\u2019d.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSo let it now; for it has been a great while going by.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think on\u2019t.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSo I do.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI\u2019ll be sworn \u2019tis true; he will weep you, and \u2019twere a man born in\nApril.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAnd I\u2019ll spring up in his tears, an \u2019twere a nettle against May.\n\n [_Sound a retreat._]\n\nPANDARUS.\nHark! they are coming from the field. Shall we stand up here and see\nthem as they pass toward Ilium? Good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAt your pleasure.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHere, here, here\u2019s an excellent place; here we may see most bravely.\nI\u2019ll tell you them all by their names as they pass by; but mark Troilus\nabove the rest.\n\n [Aeneas _passes_.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSpeak not so loud.\n\nPANDARUS.\nThat\u2019s Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He\u2019s one of the flowers of\nTroy, I can tell you. But mark Troilus; you shall see anon.\n\n [Antenor _passes_.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWho\u2019s that?\n\nPANDARUS.\nThat\u2019s Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and he\u2019s a man\ngood enough; he\u2019s one o\u2019 th\u2019 soundest judgements in Troy, whosoever,\nand a proper man of person. When comes Troilus? I\u2019ll show you Troilus\nanon. If he see me, you shall see him nod at me.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWill he give you the nod?\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou shall see.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIf he do, the rich shall have more.\n\n [Hector _passes_.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nThat\u2019s Hector, that, that, look you, that; there\u2019s a fellow! Go thy\nway, Hector! There\u2019s a brave man, niece. O brave Hector! Look how he\nlooks. There\u2019s a countenance! Is\u2019t not a brave man?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO, a brave man!\n\nPANDARUS.\nIs a\u2019 not? It does a man\u2019s heart good. Look you what hacks are on his\nhelmet! Look you yonder, do you see? Look you there. There\u2019s no\njesting; there\u2019s laying on; take\u2019t off who will, as they say. There be\nhacks.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBe those with swords?\n\nPANDARUS.\nSwords! anything, he cares not; and the devil come to him, it\u2019s all\none. By God\u2019s lid, it does one\u2019s heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder\ncomes Paris.\n\n [Paris _passes_.]\n\nLook ye yonder, niece; is\u2019t not a gallant man too, is\u2019t not? Why, this\nis brave now. Who said he came hurt home today? He\u2019s not hurt. Why,\nthis will do Helen\u2019s heart good now, ha! Would I could see Troilus now!\nYou shall see Troilus anon.\n\n [Helenus _passes_.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWho\u2019s that?\n\nPANDARUS.\nThat\u2019s Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That\u2019s\nHelenus. I think he went not forth today. That\u2019s Helenus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nCan Helenus fight, uncle?\n\nPANDARUS.\nHelenus! no. Yes, he\u2019ll fight indifferent well. I marvel where Troilus\nis. Hark! do you not hear the people cry \u2018Troilus\u2019?\u2014Helenus is a\npriest.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhat sneaking fellow comes yonder?\n\n [Troilus _passes_.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhere? yonder? That\u2019s Deiphobus. \u2019Tis Troilus. There\u2019s a man, niece.\nHem! Brave Troilus, the prince of chivalry!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nPeace, for shame, peace!\n\nPANDARUS.\nMark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him, niece; look\nyou how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more hack\u2019d than Hector\u2019s;\nand how he looks, and how he goes! O admirable youth! he never saw\nthree and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way. Had I a sister were\na grace or a daughter a goddess, he should take his choice. O admirable\nman! Paris? Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to change,\nwould give an eye to boot.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHere comes more.\n\n [_Common soldiers pass_.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nAsses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran! porridge after\nmeat! I could live and die in the eyes of Troilus. Ne\u2019er look, ne\u2019er\nlook; the eagles are gone. Crows and daws, crows and daws! I had rather\nbe such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all Greece.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThere is amongst the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAchilles? A drayman, a porter, a very camel!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWell, well.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell, well! Why, have you any discretion? Have you any eyes? Do you\nknow what a man is? Is not birth, beauty, good shape, discourse,\nmanhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality, and such\nlike, the spice and salt that season a man?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAy, a minc\u2019d man; and then to be bak\u2019d with no date in the pie, for\nthen the man\u2019s date is out.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou are such a woman! A man knows not at what ward you lie.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nUpon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend my wiles; upon\nmy secrecy, to defend mine honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and\nyou, to defend all these; and at all these wards I lie, at a thousand\nwatches.\n\nPANDARUS.\nSay one of your watches.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNay, I\u2019ll watch you for that; and that\u2019s one of the chiefest of them\ntoo. If I cannot ward what I would not have hit, I can watch you for\ntelling how I took the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it\u2019s\npast watching.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou are such another!\n\n Enter Troilus' Boy.\n\nBOY.\nSir, my lord would instantly speak with you.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhere?\n\nBOY.\nAt your own house; there he unarms him.\n\nPANDARUS.\nGood boy, tell him I come. [_Exit_ Boy.] I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye\nwell, good niece.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAdieu, uncle.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI will be with you, niece, by and by.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nTo bring, uncle.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, a token from Troilus.\n\n [_Exit_ Pandarus.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBy the same token, you are a bawd.\nWords, vows, gifts, tears, and love\u2019s full sacrifice,\nHe offers in another\u2019s enterprise;\nBut more in Troilus thousand-fold I see\nThan in the glass of Pandar\u2019s praise may be,\nYet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:\nThings won are done; joy\u2019s soul lies in the doing.\nThat she belov\u2019d knows naught that knows not this:\nMen prize the thing ungain\u2019d more than it is.\nThat she was never yet that ever knew\nLove got so sweet as when desire did sue;\nTherefore this maxim out of love I teach:\n\u2018Achievement is command; ungain\u2019d, beseech.\u2019\nThen though my heart\u2019s content firm love doth bear,\nNothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nSCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before AGAMEMNON\u2019S tent.\n\n Sennet. Enter Agamemnon, Nestor, Ulysses, Diomedes, Menelaus and\n others.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nPrinces,\nWhat grief hath set these jaundies o\u2019er your cheeks?\nThe ample proposition that hope makes\nIn all designs begun on earth below\nFails in the promis\u2019d largeness; checks and disasters\nGrow in the veins of actions highest rear\u2019d,\nAs knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,\nInfects the sound pine, and diverts his grain\nTortive and errant from his course of growth.\nNor, princes, is it matter new to us\nThat we come short of our suppose so far\nThat after seven years\u2019 siege yet Troy walls stand;\nSith every action that hath gone before,\nWhereof we have record, trial did draw\nBias and thwart, not answering the aim,\nAnd that unbodied figure of the thought\nThat gave\u2019t surmised shape. Why then, you princes,\nDo you with cheeks abash\u2019d behold our works\nAnd call them shames, which are, indeed, naught else\nBut the protractive trials of great Jove\nTo find persistive constancy in men;\nThe fineness of which metal is not found\nIn fortune\u2019s love? For then the bold and coward,\nThe wise and fool, the artist and unread,\nThe hard and soft, seem all affin\u2019d and kin.\nBut in the wind and tempest of her frown\nDistinction, with a broad and powerful fan,\nPuffing at all, winnows the light away;\nAnd what hath mass or matter by itself\nLies rich in virtue and unmingled.\n\nNESTOR.\nWith due observance of thy godlike seat,\nGreat Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply\nThy latest words. In the reproof of chance\nLies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth,\nHow many shallow bauble boats dare sail\nUpon her patient breast, making their way\nWith those of nobler bulk!\nBut let the ruffian Boreas once enrage\nThe gentle Thetis, and anon behold\nThe strong-ribb\u2019d bark through liquid mountains cut,\nBounding between the two moist elements\nLike Perseus\u2019 horse. Where\u2019s then the saucy boat,\nWhose weak untimber\u2019d sides but even now\nCo-rivall\u2019d greatness? Either to harbour fled\nOr made a toast for Neptune. Even so\nDoth valour\u2019s show and valour\u2019s worth divide\nIn storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness\nThe herd hath more annoyance by the breeze\nThan by the tiger; but when the splitting wind\nMakes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,\nAnd flies fled under shade\u2014why, then the thing of courage,\nAs rous\u2019d with rage, with rage doth sympathise,\nAnd with an accent tun\u2019d in self-same key\nRetorts to chiding fortune.\n\nULYSSES.\nAgamemnon,\nThou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,\nHeart of our numbers, soul and only spirit\nIn whom the tempers and the minds of all\nShould be shut up\u2014hear what Ulysses speaks.\nBesides th\u2019applause and approbation\nThe which, [_To Agamemnon_] most mighty, for thy place and sway,\n[_To Nestor_] And, thou most reverend, for thy stretch\u2019d-out life,\nI give to both your speeches\u2014which were such\nAs Agamemnon and the hand of Greece\nShould hold up high in brass; and such again\nAs venerable Nestor, hatch\u2019d in silver,\nShould with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree\nOn which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears\nTo his experienc\u2019d tongue\u2014yet let it please both,\nThou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nSpeak, Prince of Ithaca; and be\u2019t of less expect\nThat matter needless, of importless burden,\nDivide thy lips than we are confident,\nWhen rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,\nWe shall hear music, wit, and oracle.\n\nULYSSES.\nTroy, yet upon his basis, had been down,\nAnd the great Hector\u2019s sword had lack\u2019d a master,\nBut for these instances:\nThe specialty of rule hath been neglected;\nAnd look how many Grecian tents do stand\nHollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.\nWhen that the general is not like the hive,\nTo whom the foragers shall all repair,\nWhat honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,\nTh\u2019unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.\nThe heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,\nObserve degree, priority, and place,\nInsisture, course, proportion, season, form,\nOffice, and custom, in all line of order;\nAnd therefore is the glorious planet Sol\nIn noble eminence enthron\u2019d and spher\u2019d\nAmidst the other, whose med\u2019cinable eye\nCorrects the influence of evil planets,\nAnd posts, like the commandment of a king,\nSans check, to good and bad. But when the planets\nIn evil mixture to disorder wander,\nWhat plagues and what portents, what mutiny,\nWhat raging of the sea, shaking of earth,\nCommotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors,\nDivert and crack, rend and deracinate,\nThe unity and married calm of states\nQuite from their fixture! O, when degree is shak\u2019d,\nWhich is the ladder of all high designs,\nThe enterprise is sick! How could communities,\nDegrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,\nPeaceful commerce from dividable shores,\nThe primogenity and due of birth,\nPrerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,\nBut by degree stand in authentic place?\nTake but degree away, untune that string,\nAnd hark what discord follows! Each thing melts\nIn mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters\nShould lift their bosoms higher than the shores,\nAnd make a sop of all this solid globe;\nStrength should be lord of imbecility,\nAnd the rude son should strike his father dead;\nForce should be right; or, rather, right and wrong\u2014\nBetween whose endless jar justice resides\u2014\nShould lose their names, and so should justice too.\nThen everything includes itself in power,\nPower into will, will into appetite;\nAnd appetite, an universal wolf,\nSo doubly seconded with will and power,\nMust make perforce an universal prey,\nAnd last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,\nThis chaos, when degree is suffocate,\nFollows the choking.\nAnd this neglection of degree it is\nThat by a pace goes backward, with a purpose\nIt hath to climb. The general\u2019s disdain\u2019d\nBy him one step below, he by the next,\nThat next by him beneath; so every step,\nExampl\u2019d by the first pace that is sick\nOf his superior, grows to an envious fever\nOf pale and bloodless emulation.\nAnd \u2019tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,\nNot her own sinews. To end a tale of length,\nTroy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.\n\nNESTOR.\nMost wisely hath Ulysses here discover\u2019d\nThe fever whereof all our power is sick.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nThe nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,\nWhat is the remedy?\n\nULYSSES.\nThe great Achilles, whom opinion crowns\nThe sinew and the forehand of our host,\nHaving his ear full of his airy fame,\nGrows dainty of his worth, and in his tent\nLies mocking our designs; with him Patroclus\nUpon a lazy bed the livelong day\nBreaks scurril jests;\nAnd with ridiculous and awkward action\u2014\nWhich, slanderer, he imitation calls\u2014\nHe pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,\nThy topless deputation he puts on;\nAnd like a strutting player whose conceit\nLies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich\nTo hear the wooden dialogue and sound\n\u2019Twixt his stretch\u2019d footing and the scaffoldage\u2014\nSuch to-be-pitied and o\u2019er-wrested seeming\nHe acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks\n\u2019Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar\u2019d,\nWhich, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp\u2019d,\nWould seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff\nThe large Achilles, on his press\u2019d bed lolling,\nFrom his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;\nCries \u2018Excellent! \u2019Tis Agamemnon right!\nNow play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,\nAs he being drest to some oration.\u2019\nThat\u2019s done\u2014as near as the extremest ends\nOf parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;\nYet god Achilles still cries \u2018Excellent!\n\u2019Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,\nArming to answer in a night alarm.\u2019\nAnd then, forsooth, the faint defects of age\nMust be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit\nAnd, with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,\nShake in and out the rivet. And at this sport\nSir Valour dies; cries \u2018O, enough, Patroclus;\nOr give me ribs of steel! I shall split all\nIn pleasure of my spleen.\u2019 And in this fashion\nAll our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,\nSeverals and generals of grace exact,\nAchievements, plots, orders, preventions,\nExcitements to the field or speech for truce,\nSuccess or loss, what is or is not, serves\nAs stuff for these two to make paradoxes.\n\nNESTOR.\nAnd in the imitation of these twain\u2014\nWho, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns\nWith an imperial voice\u2014many are infect.\nAjax is grown self-will\u2019d and bears his head\nIn such a rein, in full as proud a place\nAs broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;\nMakes factious feasts; rails on our state of war\nBold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,\nA slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,\nTo match us in comparisons with dirt,\nTo weaken and discredit our exposure,\nHow rank soever rounded in with danger.\n\nULYSSES.\nThey tax our policy and call it cowardice,\nCount wisdom as no member of the war,\nForestall prescience, and esteem no act\nBut that of hand. The still and mental parts\nThat do contrive how many hands shall strike\nWhen fitness calls them on, and know, by measure\nOf their observant toil, the enemies\u2019 weight\u2014\nWhy, this hath not a finger\u2019s dignity:\nThey call this bed-work, mapp\u2019ry, closet-war;\nSo that the ram that batters down the wall,\nFor the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,\nThey place before his hand that made the engine,\nOr those that with the fineness of their souls\nBy reason guide his execution.\n\nNESTOR.\nLet this be granted, and Achilles\u2019 horse\nMakes many Thetis\u2019 sons.\n\n [_Tucket_.]\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat trumpet? Look, Menelaus.\n\nMENELAUS.\nFrom Troy.\n\n Enter Aeneas.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat would you fore our tent?\n\nAENEAS.\nIs this great Agamemnon\u2019s tent, I pray you?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nEven this.\n\nAENEAS.\nMay one that is a herald and a prince\nDo a fair message to his kingly eyes?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWith surety stronger than Achilles\u2019 arm\nFore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice\nCall Agamemnon head and general.\n\nAENEAS.\nFair leave and large security. How may\nA stranger to those most imperial looks\nKnow them from eyes of other mortals?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nHow?\n\nAENEAS.\nAy;\nI ask, that I might waken reverence,\nAnd bid the cheek be ready with a blush\nModest as morning when she coldly eyes\nThe youthful Phoebus.\nWhich is that god in office, guiding men?\nWhich is the high and mighty Agamemnon?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nThis Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy\nAre ceremonious courtiers.\n\nAENEAS.\nCourtiers as free, as debonair, unarm\u2019d,\nAs bending angels; that\u2019s their fame in peace.\nBut when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,\nGood arms, strong joints, true swords; and, Jove\u2019s accord,\nNothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas,\nPeace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips.\nThe worthiness of praise distains his worth,\nIf that the prais\u2019d himself bring the praise forth;\nBut what the repining enemy commends,\nThat breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure, transcends.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nSir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?\n\nAENEAS.\nAy, Greek, that is my name.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat\u2019s your affairs, I pray you?\n\nAENEAS.\nSir, pardon; \u2019tis for Agamemnon\u2019s ears.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHe hears naught privately that comes from Troy.\n\nAENEAS.\nNor I from Troy come not to whisper with him;\nI bring a trumpet to awake his ear,\nTo set his sense on the attentive bent,\nAnd then to speak.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nSpeak frankly as the wind;\nIt is not Agamemnon\u2019s sleeping hour.\nThat thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,\nHe tells thee so himself.\n\nAENEAS.\nTrumpet, blow loud,\nSend thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;\nAnd every Greek of mettle, let him know\nWhat Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.\n\n [_Sound trumpet_.]\n\nWe have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy\nA prince called Hector\u2014Priam is his father\u2014\nWho in this dull and long-continued truce\nIs resty grown; he bade me take a trumpet\nAnd to this purpose speak: Kings, princes, lords!\nIf there be one among the fair\u2019st of Greece\nThat holds his honour higher than his ease,\nThat feeds his praise more than he fears his peril,\nThat knows his valour and knows not his fear,\nThat loves his mistress more than in confession\nWith truant vows to her own lips he loves,\nAnd dare avow her beauty and her worth\nIn other arms than hers\u2014to him this challenge.\nHector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,\nShall make it good or do his best to do it:\nHe hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer,\nThan ever Greek did couple in his arms;\nAnd will tomorrow with his trumpet call\nMid-way between your tents and walls of Troy\nTo rouse a Grecian that is true in love.\nIf any come, Hector shall honour him;\nIf none, he\u2019ll say in Troy, when he retires,\nThe Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth\nThe splinter of a lance. Even so much.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nThis shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.\nIf none of them have soul in such a kind,\nWe left them all at home. But we are soldiers;\nAnd may that soldier a mere recreant prove\nThat means not, hath not, or is not in love.\nIf then one is, or hath, or means to be,\nThat one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.\n\nNESTOR.\nTell him of Nestor, one that was a man\nWhen Hector\u2019s grandsire suck\u2019d. He is old now;\nBut if there be not in our Grecian host\nA noble man that hath one spark of fire\nTo answer for his love, tell him from me\nI\u2019ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,\nAnd in my vambrace put this wither\u2019d brawns,\nAnd meeting him, will tell him that my lady\nWas fairer than his grandam, and as chaste\nAs may be in the world. His youth in flood,\nI\u2019ll prove this troth with my three drops of blood.\n\nAENEAS.\nNow heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!\n\nULYSSES.\nAmen.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nFair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand;\nTo our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.\nAchilles shall have word of this intent;\nSo shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent.\nYourself shall feast with us before you go,\nAnd find the welcome of a noble foe.\n\n [_Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor_.]\n\nULYSSES.\nNestor!\n\nNESTOR.\nWhat says Ulysses?\n\nULYSSES.\nI have a young conception in my brain;\nBe you my time to bring it to some shape.\n\nNESTOR.\nWhat is\u2019t?\n\nULYSSES.\nThis \u2019tis:\nBlunt wedges rive hard knots. The seeded pride\nThat hath to this maturity blown up\nIn rank Achilles must or now be cropp\u2019d\nOr, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil\nTo overbulk us all.\n\nNESTOR.\nWell, and how?\n\nULYSSES.\nThis challenge that the gallant Hector sends,\nHowever it is spread in general name,\nRelates in purpose only to Achilles.\n\nNESTOR.\nTrue. The purpose is perspicuous even as substance\nWhose grossness little characters sum up;\nAnd, in the publication, make no strain\nBut that Achilles, were his brain as barren\nAs banks of Libya\u2014though, Apollo knows,\n\u2019Tis dry enough\u2014will with great speed of judgement,\nAy, with celerity, find Hector\u2019s purpose\nPointing on him.\n\nULYSSES.\nAnd wake him to the answer, think you?\n\nNESTOR.\nWhy, \u2019tis most meet. Who may you else oppose\nThat can from Hector bring those honours off,\nIf not Achilles? Though \u2019t be a sportful combat,\nYet in this trial much opinion dwells\nFor here the Trojans taste our dear\u2019st repute\nWith their fin\u2019st palate; and trust to me, Ulysses,\nOur imputation shall be oddly pois\u2019d\nIn this vile action; for the success,\nAlthough particular, shall give a scantling\nOf good or bad unto the general;\nAnd in such indexes, although small pricks\nTo their subsequent volumes, there is seen\nThe baby figure of the giant mass\nOf things to come at large. It is suppos\u2019d\nHe that meets Hector issues from our choice;\nAnd choice, being mutual act of all our souls,\nMakes merit her election, and doth boil,\nAs \u2019twere from forth us all, a man distill\u2019d\nOut of our virtues; who miscarrying,\nWhat heart receives from hence a conquering part,\nTo steel a strong opinion to themselves?\nWhich entertain\u2019d, limbs are his instruments,\nIn no less working than are swords and bows\nDirective by the limbs.\n\nULYSSES.\nGive pardon to my speech. Therefore \u2019tis meet\nAchilles meet not Hector. Let us, like merchants,\nFirst show foul wares, and think perchance they\u2019ll sell;\nIf not, the lustre of the better shall exceed\nBy showing the worse first. Do not consent\nThat ever Hector and Achilles meet;\nFor both our honour and our shame in this\nAre dogg\u2019d with two strange followers.\n\nNESTOR.\nI see them not with my old eyes. What are they?\n\nULYSSES.\nWhat glory our Achilles shares from Hector,\nWere he not proud, we all should share with him;\nBut he already is too insolent;\nAnd it were better parch in Afric sun\nThan in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,\nShould he scape Hector fair. If he were foil\u2019d,\nWhy, then we do our main opinion crush\nIn taint of our best man. No, make a lott\u2019ry;\nAnd, by device, let blockish Ajax draw\nThe sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves\nGive him allowance for the better man;\nFor that will physic the great Myrmidon,\nWho broils in loud applause, and make him fall\nHis crest, that prouder than blue Iris bends.\nIf the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,\nWe\u2019ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,\nYet go we under our opinion still\nThat we have better men. But, hit or miss,\nOur project\u2019s life this shape of sense assumes\u2014\nAjax employ\u2019d plucks down Achilles\u2019 plumes.\n\nNESTOR.\nNow, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice;\nAnd I will give a taste thereof forthwith\nTo Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.\nTwo curs shall tame each other: pride alone\nMust tarre the mastiffs on, as \u2019twere their bone.\n\n [_Exeunt_.]\n\n\n\nACT II.\n\nSCENE I.

PRIAM\u2019S palace.\n\n Enter Priam, Hector, Troilus, Paris and Helenus.\n\nPRIAM.\nAfter so many hours, lives, speeches spent,\nThus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:\n\u2018Deliver Helen, and all damage else\u2014\nAs honour, loss of time, travail, expense,\nWounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum\u2019d\nIn hot digestion of this cormorant war\u2014\nShall be struck off.\u2019 Hector, what say you to\u2019t?\n\nHECTOR.\nThough no man lesser fears the Greeks than I,\nAs far as toucheth my particular,\nYet, dread Priam,\nThere is no lady of more softer bowels,\nMore spongy to suck in the sense of fear,\nMore ready to cry out \u2018Who knows what follows?\u2019\nThan Hector is. The wound of peace is surety,\nSurety secure; but modest doubt is call\u2019d\nThe beacon of the wise, the tent that searches\nTo th\u2019 bottom of the worst. Let Helen go.\nSince the first sword was drawn about this question,\nEvery tithe soul \u2019mongst many thousand dismes\nHath been as dear as Helen\u2014I mean, of ours.\nIf we have lost so many tenths of ours\nTo guard a thing not ours, nor worth to us,\nHad it our name, the value of one ten,\nWhat merit\u2019s in that reason which denies\nThe yielding of her up?\n\nTROILUS.\nFie, fie, my brother!\nWeigh you the worth and honour of a king,\nSo great as our dread father\u2019s, in a scale\nOf common ounces? Will you with counters sum\nThe past-proportion of his infinite,\nAnd buckle in a waist most fathomless\nWith spans and inches so diminutive\nAs fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!\n\nHELENUS.\nNo marvel though you bite so sharp of reasons,\nYou are so empty of them. Should not our father\nBear the great sway of his affairs with reason,\nBecause your speech hath none that tells him so?\n\nTROILUS.\nYou are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;\nYou fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:\nYou know an enemy intends you harm;\nYou know a sword employ\u2019d is perilous,\nAnd reason flies the object of all harm.\nWho marvels, then, when Helenus beholds\nA Grecian and his sword, if he do set\nThe very wings of reason to his heels\nAnd fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,\nOr like a star disorb\u2019d? Nay, if we talk of reason,\nLet\u2019s shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honour\nShould have hare hearts, would they but fat their thoughts\nWith this cramm\u2019d reason. Reason and respect\nMake livers pale and lustihood deject.\n\nHECTOR.\nBrother, she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping.\n\nTROILUS.\nWhat\u2019s aught but as \u2019tis valued?\n\nHECTOR.\nBut value dwells not in particular will:\nIt holds his estimate and dignity\nAs well wherein \u2019tis precious of itself\nAs in the prizer. \u2019Tis mad idolatry\nTo make the service greater than the god,\nAnd the will dotes that is attributive\nTo what infectiously itself affects,\nWithout some image of th\u2019affected merit.\n\nTROILUS.\nI take today a wife, and my election\nIs led on in the conduct of my will;\nMy will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,\nTwo traded pilots \u2019twixt the dangerous shores\nOf will and judgement: how may I avoid,\nAlthough my will distaste what it elected,\nThe wife I chose? There can be no evasion\nTo blench from this and to stand firm by honour.\nWe turn not back the silks upon the merchant\nWhen we have soil\u2019d them; nor the remainder viands\nWe do not throw in unrespective sieve,\nBecause we now are full. It was thought meet\nParis should do some vengeance on the Greeks;\nYour breath with full consent bellied his sails;\nThe seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,\nAnd did him service. He touch\u2019d the ports desir\u2019d;\nAnd for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive\nHe brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness\nWrinkles Apollo\u2019s, and makes stale the morning.\nWhy keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.\nIs she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl\nWhose price hath launch\u2019d above a thousand ships,\nAnd turn\u2019d crown\u2019d kings to merchants.\nIf you\u2019ll avouch \u2019twas wisdom Paris went\u2014\nAs you must needs, for you all cried \u2018Go, go\u2019\u2014\nIf you\u2019ll confess he brought home worthy prize\u2014\nAs you must needs, for you all clapp\u2019d your hands,\nAnd cried \u2018Inestimable!\u2019\u2014why do you now\nThe issue of your proper wisdoms rate,\nAnd do a deed that never Fortune did\u2014\nBeggar the estimation which you priz\u2019d\nRicher than sea and land? O theft most base,\nThat we have stol\u2019n what we do fear to keep!\nBut thieves unworthy of a thing so stol\u2019n\nThat in their country did them that disgrace\nWe fear to warrant in our native place!\n\nCASSANDRA.\n[_Within_.] Cry, Trojans, cry.\n\nPRIAM.\nWhat noise, what shriek is this?\n\nTROILUS.\n\u2019Tis our mad sister; I do know her voice.\n\nCASSANDRA.\n[_Within_.] Cry, Trojans.\n\nHECTOR.\nIt is Cassandra.\n\n Enter Cassandra, raving.\n\nCASSANDRA.\nCry, Trojans, cry. Lend me ten thousand eyes,\nAnd I will fill them with prophetic tears.\n\nHECTOR.\nPeace, sister, peace.\n\nCASSANDRA.\nVirgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,\nSoft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,\nAdd to my clamours. Let us pay betimes\nA moiety of that mass of moan to come.\nCry, Trojans, cry. Practise your eyes with tears.\nTroy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;\nOur firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.\nCry, Trojans, cry, A Helen and a woe!\nCry, cry. Troy burns, or else let Helen go.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nHECTOR.\nNow, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains\nOf divination in our sister work\nSome touches of remorse? Or is your blood\nSo madly hot, that no discourse of reason,\nNor fear of bad success in a bad cause,\nCan qualify the same?\n\nTROILUS.\nWhy, brother Hector,\nWe may not think the justness of each act\nSuch and no other than event doth form it;\nNor once deject the courage of our minds\nBecause Cassandra\u2019s mad. Her brain-sick raptures\nCannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel\nWhich hath our several honours all engag\u2019d\nTo make it gracious. For my private part,\nI am no more touch\u2019d than all Priam\u2019s sons;\nAnd Jove forbid there should be done amongst us\nSuch things as might offend the weakest spleen\nTo fight for and maintain.\n\nPARIS.\nElse might the world convince of levity\nAs well my undertakings as your counsels;\nBut I attest the gods, your full consent\nGave wings to my propension, and cut off\nAll fears attending on so dire a project.\nFor what, alas, can these my single arms?\nWhat propugnation is in one man\u2019s valour\nTo stand the push and enmity of those\nThis quarrel would excite? Yet I protest,\nWere I alone to pass the difficulties,\nAnd had as ample power as I have will,\nParis should ne\u2019er retract what he hath done,\nNor faint in the pursuit.\n\nPRIAM.\nParis, you speak\nLike one besotted on your sweet delights.\nYou have the honey still, but these the gall;\nSo to be valiant is no praise at all.\n\nPARIS.\nSir, I propose not merely to myself\nThe pleasures such a beauty brings with it;\nBut I would have the soil of her fair rape\nWip\u2019d off in honourable keeping her.\nWhat treason were it to the ransack\u2019d queen,\nDisgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,\nNow to deliver her possession up\nOn terms of base compulsion! Can it be,\nThat so degenerate a strain as this\nShould once set footing in your generous bosoms?\nThere\u2019s not the meanest spirit on our party\nWithout a heart to dare or sword to draw\nWhen Helen is defended; nor none so noble\nWhose life were ill bestow\u2019d or death unfam\u2019d,\nWhere Helen is the subject. Then, I say,\nWell may we fight for her whom we know well\nThe world\u2019s large spaces cannot parallel.\n\nHECTOR.\nParis and Troilus, you have both said well;\nAnd on the cause and question now in hand\nHave gloz\u2019d, but superficially; not much\nUnlike young men, whom Aristotle thought\nUnfit to hear moral philosophy.\nThe reasons you allege do more conduce\nTo the hot passion of distemp\u2019red blood\nThan to make up a free determination\n\u2019Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge\nHave ears more deaf than adders to the voice\nOf any true decision. Nature craves\nAll dues be rend\u2019red to their owners. Now,\nWhat nearer debt in all humanity\nThan wife is to the husband? If this law\nOf nature be corrupted through affection;\nAnd that great minds, of partial indulgence\nTo their benumbed wills, resist the same;\nThere is a law in each well-order\u2019d nation\nTo curb those raging appetites that are\nMost disobedient and refractory.\nIf Helen, then, be wife to Sparta\u2019s king\u2014\nAs it is known she is\u2014these moral laws\nOf nature and of nations speak aloud\nTo have her back return\u2019d. Thus to persist\nIn doing wrong extenuates not wrong,\nBut makes it much more heavy. Hector\u2019s opinion\nIs this, in way of truth. Yet, ne\u2019ertheless,\nMy spritely brethren, I propend to you\nIn resolution to keep Helen still;\nFor \u2019tis a cause that hath no mean dependence\nUpon our joint and several dignities.\n\nTROILUS.\nWhy, there you touch\u2019d the life of our design.\nWere it not glory that we more affected\nThan the performance of our heaving spleens,\nI would not wish a drop of Trojan blood\nSpent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,\nShe is a theme of honour and renown,\nA spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,\nWhose present courage may beat down our foes,\nAnd fame in time to come canonize us;\nFor I presume brave Hector would not lose\nSo rich advantage of a promis\u2019d glory\nAs smiles upon the forehead of this action\nFor the wide world\u2019s revenue.\n\nHECTOR.\nI am yours,\nYou valiant offspring of great Priamus.\nI have a roisting challenge sent amongst\nThe dull and factious nobles of the Greeks\nWill strike amazement to their drowsy spirits.\nI was advertis\u2019d their great general slept,\nWhilst emulation in the army crept.\nThis, I presume, will wake him.\n\n [_Exeunt_.]\n\nSCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before the tent of ACHILLES.\n\n Enter Thersites, solus.\n\nTHERSITES.\nHow now, Thersites! What, lost in the labyrinth of thy fury? Shall the\nelephant Ajax carry it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him. O worthy\nsatisfaction! Would it were otherwise: that I could beat him, whilst he\nrail\u2019d at me! \u2018Sfoot, I\u2019ll learn to conjure and raise devils, but I\u2019ll\nsee some issue of my spiteful execrations. Then there\u2019s Achilles, a\nrare engineer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the\nwalls will stand till they fall of themselves. O thou great\nthunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods,\nand, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take\nnot that little little less than little wit from them that they have!\nwhich short-arm\u2019d ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce, it will\nnot in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their\nmassy irons and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the whole\ncamp! or, rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache! for that, methinks, is the\ncurse depending on those that war for a placket. I have said my\nprayers; and devil Envy say \u2018Amen.\u2019 What ho! my Lord Achilles!\n\n Enter Patroclus.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWho\u2019s there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.\n\nTHERSITES.\nIf I could a\u2019 rememb\u2019red a gilt counterfeit, thou wouldst not have\nslipp\u2019d out of my contemplation; but it is no matter; thyself upon\nthyself! The common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in\ngreat revenue! Heaven bless thee from a tutor, and discipline come not\nnear thee! Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death. Then if she\nthat lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I\u2019ll be sworn and sworn\nupon\u2019t she never shrouded any but lazars. Amen. Where\u2019s Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWhat, art thou devout? Wast thou in prayer?\n\nTHERSITES.\nAy, the heavens hear me!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nAmen.\n\n Enter Achilles.\n\nACHILLES.\nWho\u2019s there?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nThersites, my lord.\n\nACHILLES.\nWhere, where? O, where? Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my digestion,\nwhy hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals? Come,\nwhat\u2019s Agamemnon?\n\nTHERSITES.\nThy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus, what\u2019s Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nThy lord, Thersites. Then tell me, I pray thee, what\u2019s Thersites?\n\nTHERSITES.\nThy knower, Patroclus. Then tell me, Patroclus, what art thou?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nThou must tell that knowest.\n\nACHILLES.\nO, tell, tell,\n\nTHERSITES.\nI\u2019ll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands Achilles; Achilles\nis my lord; I am Patroclus\u2019 knower; and Patroclus is a fool.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nYou rascal!\n\nTHERSITES.\nPeace, fool! I have not done.\n\nACHILLES.\nHe is a privileg\u2019d man. Proceed, Thersites.\n\nTHERSITES.\nAgamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites is a fool; and, as\naforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.\n\nACHILLES.\nDerive this; come.\n\nTHERSITES.\nAgamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles; Achilles is a fool to\nbe commanded of Agamemnon; Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool;\nand this Patroclus is a fool positive.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWhy am I a fool?\n\nTHERSITES.\nMake that demand of the Creator. It suffices me thou art. Look you, who\ncomes here?\n\n Enter Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, Diomedes, Ajax and Calchas.\n\nACHILLES.\nCome, Patroclus, I\u2019ll speak with nobody. Come in with me, Thersites.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nTHERSITES.\nHere is such patchery, such juggling, and such knavery. All the\nargument is a whore and a cuckold\u2014a good quarrel to draw emulous\nfactions and bleed to death upon. Now the dry serpigo on the subject,\nand war and lechery confound all!\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhere is Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWithin his tent; but ill-dispos\u2019d, my lord.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nLet it be known to him that we are here.\nHe sate our messengers; and we lay by\nOur appertainings, visiting of him.\nLet him be told so; lest, perchance, he think\nWe dare not move the question of our place\nOr know not what we are.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nI shall say so to him.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nULYSSES.\nWe saw him at the opening of his tent.\nHe is not sick.\n\nAJAX.\nYes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call it melancholy, if you\nwill favour the man; but, by my head, \u2019tis pride. But why, why? Let him\nshow us a cause. A word, my lord.\n\n [_Takes Agamemnon aside_.]\n\nNESTOR.\nWhat moves Ajax thus to bay at him?\n\nULYSSES.\nAchilles hath inveigled his fool from him.\n\nNESTOR.\nWho, Thersites?\n\nULYSSES.\nHe.\n\nNESTOR.\nThen will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.\n\nULYSSES.\nNo; you see he is his argument that has his argument, Achilles.\n\nNESTOR.\nAll the better; their fraction is more our wish than their faction. But\nit was a strong composure a fool could disunite!\n\nULYSSES.\nThe amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie.\n\n Re-enter Patroclus.\n\nHere comes Patroclus.\n\nNESTOR.\nNo Achilles with him.\n\nULYSSES.\nThe elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy; his legs are legs for\nnecessity, not for flexure.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nAchilles bids me say he is much sorry\nIf any thing more than your sport and pleasure\nDid move your greatness and this noble state\nTo call upon him; he hopes it is no other\nBut for your health and your digestion sake,\nAn after-dinner\u2019s breath.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nHear you, Patroclus.\nWe are too well acquainted with these answers;\nBut his evasion, wing\u2019d thus swift with scorn,\nCannot outfly our apprehensions.\nMuch attribute he hath, and much the reason\nWhy we ascribe it to him. Yet all his virtues,\nNot virtuously on his own part beheld,\nDo in our eyes begin to lose their gloss;\nYea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,\nAre like to rot untasted. Go and tell him\nWe come to speak with him; and you shall not sin\nIf you do say we think him over-proud\nAnd under-honest, in self-assumption greater\nThan in the note of judgement; and worthier than himself\nHere tend the savage strangeness he puts on,\nDisguise the holy strength of their command,\nAnd underwrite in an observing kind\nHis humorous predominance; yea, watch\nHis course and time, his ebbs and flows, as if\nThe passage and whole stream of this commencement\nRode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add\nThat if he overhold his price so much\nWe\u2019ll none of him, but let him, like an engine\nNot portable, lie under this report:\nBring action hither; this cannot go to war.\nA stirring dwarf we do allowance give\nBefore a sleeping giant. Tell him so.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nI shall, and bring his answer presently.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nIn second voice we\u2019ll not be satisfied;\nWe come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.\n\n [_Exit_ Ulysses.]\n\nAJAX.\nWhat is he more than another?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nNo more than what he thinks he is.\n\nAJAX.\nIs he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I\nam?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nNo question.\n\nAJAX.\nWill you subscribe his thought and say he is?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nNo, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no less noble,\nmuch more gentle, and altogether more tractable.\n\nAJAX.\nWhy should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what pride\nis.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nYour mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the fairer. He that is\nproud eats up himself. Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own\nchronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed\nin the praise.\n\n Re-enter Ulysses.\n\nAJAX.\nI do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend\u2019ring of toads.\n\nNESTOR.\n[_Aside._] And yet he loves himself: is\u2019t not strange?\n\nULYSSES.\nAchilles will not to the field tomorrow.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat\u2019s his excuse?\n\nULYSSES.\nHe doth rely on none;\nBut carries on the stream of his dispose,\nWithout observance or respect of any,\nIn will peculiar and in self-admission.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhy will he not, upon our fair request,\nUntent his person and share th\u2019air with us?\n\nULYSSES.\nThings small as nothing, for request\u2019s sake only,\nHe makes important; possess\u2019d he is with greatness,\nAnd speaks not to himself but with a pride\nThat quarrels at self-breath. Imagin\u2019d worth\nHolds in his blood such swol\u2019n and hot discourse\nThat \u2019twixt his mental and his active parts\nKingdom\u2019d Achilles in commotion rages,\nAnd batters down himself. What should I say?\nHe is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it\nCry \u2018No recovery.\u2019\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nLet Ajax go to him.\nDear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.\n\u2019Tis said he holds you well; and will be led\nAt your request a little from himself.\n\nULYSSES.\nO Agamemnon, let it not be so!\nWe\u2019ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes\nWhen they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord\nThat bastes his arrogance with his own seam\nAnd never suffers matter of the world\nEnter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve\nAnd ruminate himself\u2014shall he be worshipp\u2019d\nOf that we hold an idol more than he?\nNo, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord\nShall not so stale his palm, nobly acquir\u2019d,\nNor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,\nAs amply titled as Achilles is,\nBy going to Achilles.\nThat were to enlard his fat-already pride,\nAnd add more coals to Cancer when he burns\nWith entertaining great Hyperion.\nThis lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,\nAnd say in thunder \u2018Achilles go to him.\u2019\n\nNESTOR.\n[_Aside_.] O, this is well! He rubs the vein of him.\n\nDIOMEDES.\n[_Aside_.] And how his silence drinks up this applause!\n\nAJAX.\nIf I go to him, with my armed fist I\u2019ll pash him o\u2019er the face.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nO, no, you shall not go.\n\nAJAX.\nAn a\u2019 be proud with me I\u2019ll pheeze his pride.\nLet me go to him.\n\nULYSSES.\nNot for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.\n\nAJAX.\nA paltry, insolent fellow!\n\nNESTOR.\n[_Aside_.] How he describes himself!\n\nAJAX.\nCan he not be sociable?\n\nULYSSES.\n[_Aside_.] The raven chides blackness.\n\nAJAX.\nI\u2019ll let his humours blood.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\n[_Aside_.] He will be the physician that should be the patient.\n\nAJAX.\nAnd all men were o\u2019 my mind\u2014\n\nULYSSES.\n[_Aside_.] Wit would be out of fashion.\n\nAJAX.\nA\u2019 should not bear it so, a\u2019 should eat\u2019s words first.\nShall pride carry it?\n\nNESTOR.\n[_Aside_.] And \u2019twould, you\u2019d carry half.\n\nULYSSES.\n[_Aside_.] A\u2019 would have ten shares.\n\nAJAX.\nI will knead him, I\u2019ll make him supple.\n\nNESTOR.\n[_Aside_.] He\u2019s not yet through warm. Force him with praises; pour in,\npour in; his ambition is dry.\n\nULYSSES.\n[_To Agamemnon_.] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.\n\nNESTOR.\nOur noble general, do not do so.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nYou must prepare to fight without Achilles.\n\nULYSSES.\nWhy \u2019tis this naming of him does him harm.\nHere is a man\u2014but \u2019tis before his face;\nI will be silent.\n\nNESTOR.\nWherefore should you so?\nHe is not emulous, as Achilles is.\n\nULYSSES.\nKnow the whole world, he is as valiant.\n\nAJAX.\nA whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!\nWould he were a Trojan!\n\nNESTOR.\nWhat a vice were it in Ajax now\u2014\n\nULYSSES.\nIf he were proud.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nOr covetous of praise.\n\nULYSSES.\nAy, or surly borne.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nOr strange, or self-affected.\n\nULYSSES.\nThank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure\nPraise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck;\nFam\u2019d be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature\nThrice fam\u2019d beyond, beyond all erudition;\nBut he that disciplin\u2019d thine arms to fight\u2014\nLet Mars divide eternity in twain\nAnd give him half; and, for thy vigour,\nBull-bearing Milo his addition yield\nTo sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,\nWhich, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines\nThy spacious and dilated parts. Here\u2019s Nestor,\nInstructed by the antiquary times\u2014\nHe must, he is, he cannot but be wise;\nBut pardon, father Nestor, were your days\nAs green as Ajax\u2019 and your brain so temper\u2019d,\nYou should not have the eminence of him,\nBut be as Ajax.\n\nAJAX.\nShall I call you father?\n\nNESTOR.\nAy, my good son.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nBe rul\u2019d by him, Lord Ajax.\n\nULYSSES.\nThere is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles\nKeeps thicket. Please it our great general\nTo call together all his state of war;\nFresh kings are come to Troy. Tomorrow\nWe must with all our main of power stand fast;\nAnd here\u2019s a lord\u2014come knights from east to west\nAnd cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nGo we to council. Let Achilles sleep.\nLight boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.\n\n [_Exeunt_.]\n\n\n\nACT III.\n\nSCENE I. Troy. PRIAM\u2019S palace.\n\n Music sounds within. Enter Pandarus and a Servant.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFriend, you\u2014pray you, a word. Do you not follow the young Lord Paris?\n\nSERVANT.\nAy, sir, when he goes before me.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou depend upon him, I mean?\n\nSERVANT.\nSir, I do depend upon the Lord.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou depend upon a notable gentleman; I must needs praise him.\n\nSERVANT.\nThe Lord be praised!\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou know me, do you not?\n\nSERVANT.\nFaith, sir, superficially.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFriend, know me better: I am the Lord Pandarus.\n\nSERVANT.\nI hope I shall know your honour better.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI do desire it.\n\nSERVANT.\nYou are in the state of grace?\n\nPANDARUS.\nGrace? Not so, friend; honour and lordship are my titles. What music is\nthis?\n\nSERVANT.\nI do but partly know, sir; it is music in parts.\n\nPANDARUS.\nKnow you the musicians?\n\nSERVANT.\nWholly, sir.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWho play they to?\n\nSERVANT.\nTo the hearers, sir.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAt whose pleasure, friend?\n\nSERVANT.\nAt mine, sir, and theirs that love music.\n\nPANDARUS.\nCommand, I mean, friend.\n\nSERVANT.\nWho shall I command, sir?\n\nPANDARUS.\nFriend, we understand not one another: I am too courtly, and thou art\ntoo cunning. At whose request do these men play?\n\nSERVANT.\nThat\u2019s to\u2019t, indeed, sir. Marry, sir, at the request of Paris my lord,\nwho is there in person; with him the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of\nbeauty, love\u2019s invisible soul\u2014\n\nPANDARUS.\nWho, my cousin, Cressida?\n\nSERVANT.\nNo, sir, Helen. Could not you find out that by her attributes?\n\nPANDARUS.\nIt should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the Lady Cressida. I\ncome to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus; I will make a\ncomplimental assault upon him, for my business seethes.\n\nSERVANT.\nSodden business! There\u2019s a stew\u2019d phrase indeed!\n\n Enter Paris and Helen, attended.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair company! Fair desires, in\nall fair measure, fairly guide them\u2014especially to you, fair queen! Fair\nthoughts be your fair pillow.\n\nHELEN.\nDear lord, you are full of fair words.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair prince, here is good\nbroken music.\n\nPARIS.\nYou have broke it, cousin; and by my life, you shall make it whole\nagain; you shall piece it out with a piece of your performance.\n\nHELEN.\nHe is full of harmony.\n\nPANDARUS.\nTruly, lady, no.\n\nHELEN.\nO, sir\u2014\n\nPANDARUS.\nRude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.\n\nPARIS.\nWell said, my lord. Well, you say so in fits.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord, will you vouchsafe me\na word?\n\nHELEN.\nNay, this shall not hedge us out. We\u2019ll hear you sing, certainly\u2014\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell sweet queen, you are pleasant with me. But, marry, thus, my lord:\nmy dear lord and most esteemed friend, your brother Troilus\u2014\n\nHELEN.\nMy Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord\u2014\n\nPANDARUS.\nGo to, sweet queen, go to\u2014commends himself most affectionately to you\u2014\n\nHELEN.\nYou shall not bob us out of our melody. If you do, our melancholy upon\nyour head!\n\nPANDARUS.\nSweet queen, sweet queen; that\u2019s a sweet queen, i\u2019 faith.\n\nHELEN.\nAnd to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall it not, in truth, la.\nNay, I care not for such words; no, no.\u2014And, my lord, he desires you\nthat, if the King call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.\n\nHELEN.\nMy Lord Pandarus!\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?\n\nPARIS.\nWhat exploit\u2019s in hand? Where sups he tonight?\n\nHELEN.\nNay, but, my lord\u2014\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat says my sweet queen?\u2014My cousin will fall out with you.\n\nHELEN.\nYou must not know where he sups.\n\nPARIS.\nI\u2019ll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNo, no, no such matter; you are wide. Come, your disposer is sick.\n\nPARIS.\nWell, I\u2019ll make\u2019s excuse.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?\nNo, your poor disposer\u2019s sick.\n\nPARIS.\nI spy.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou spy! What do you spy?\u2014Come, give me an instrument. Now, sweet\nqueen.\n\nHELEN.\nWhy, this is kindly done.\n\nPANDARUS.\nMy niece is horribly in love with a thing you have, sweet queen.\n\nHELEN.\nShe shall have it, my lord, if it be not my Lord Paris.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHe? No, she\u2019ll none of him; they two are twain.\n\nHELEN.\nFalling in, after falling out, may make them three.\n\nPANDARUS.\nCome, come. I\u2019ll hear no more of this; I\u2019ll sing you a song now.\n\nHELEN.\nAy, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou hast a fine\nforehead.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, you may, you may.\n\nHELEN.\nLet thy song be love. This love will undo us all. O Cupid, Cupid,\nCupid!\n\nPANDARUS.\nLove! Ay, that it shall, i\u2019 faith.\n\nPARIS.\nAy, good now, love, love, nothing but love.\n\nPANDARUS.\nIn good troth, it begins so.\n\n [_Sings_.]\n\n\n          _Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!\n           For, oh, love\u2019s bow\n            Shoots buck and doe;\n            The shaft confounds\n              Not that it wounds,\n             But tickles still the sore.\n         These lovers cry, O ho, they die!\n               Yet that which seems the wound to kill\n         Doth turn O ho! to ha! ha! he!\n                So dying love lives still.\n         O ho! a while, but ha! ha! ha!\n         O ho! groans out for ha! ha! ha!\u2014hey ho!_\n\nHELEN.\nIn love, i\u2019 faith, to the very tip of the nose.\n\nPARIS.\nHe eats nothing but doves, love; and that breeds hot blood, and hot\nblood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot\ndeeds is love.\n\nPANDARUS.\nIs this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts, and hot deeds?\nWhy, they are vipers. Is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who\u2019s\na-field today?\n\nPARIS.\nHector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the gallantry of Troy. I\nwould fain have arm\u2019d today, but my Nell would not have it so. How\nchance my brother Troilus went not?\n\nHELEN.\nHe hangs the lip at something. You know all, Lord Pandarus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNot I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they spend today. You\u2019ll\nremember your brother\u2019s excuse?\n\nPARIS.\nTo a hair.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFarewell, sweet queen.\n\nHELEN.\nCommend me to your niece.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI will, sweet queen.\n\n [_Exit. Sound a retreat_.]\n\nPARIS.\nThey\u2019re come from the field. Let us to Priam\u2019s hall\nTo greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you\nTo help unarm our Hector. His stubborn buckles,\nWith these your white enchanting fingers touch\u2019d,\nShall more obey than to the edge of steel\nOr force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more\nThan all the island kings\u2014disarm great Hector.\n\nHELEN.\n\u2019Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;\nYea, what he shall receive of us in duty\nGives us more palm in beauty than we have,\nYea, overshines ourself.\n\nPARIS.\nSweet, above thought I love thee.\n\n [_Exeunt_.]\n\nSCENE II. Troy. PANDARUS\u2019 orchard.\n\n Enter Pandarus and Troilus\u2019 Boy, meeting.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHow now! Where\u2019s thy master? At my cousin Cressida\u2019s?\n\nBOY.\nNo, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.\n\n Enter Troilus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nO, here he comes. How now, how now?\n\nTROILUS.\nSirrah, walk off.\n\n [_Exit_ Boy.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nHave you seen my cousin?\n\nTROILUS.\nNo, Pandarus. I stalk about her door\nLike a strange soul upon the Stygian banks\nStaying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,\nAnd give me swift transportance to these fields\nWhere I may wallow in the lily beds\nPropos\u2019d for the deserver! O gentle Pandar,\nfrom Cupid\u2019s shoulder pluck his painted wings,\nand fly with me to Cressid!\n\nPANDARUS.\nWalk here i\u2019 th\u2019 orchard, I\u2019ll bring her straight.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nTROILUS.\nI am giddy; expectation whirls me round.\nTh\u2019imaginary relish is so sweet\nThat it enchants my sense; what will it be\nWhen that the wat\u2019ry palate tastes indeed\nLove\u2019s thrice-repured nectar? Death, I fear me;\nSounding destruction; or some joy too fine,\nToo subtle-potent, tun\u2019d too sharp in sweetness,\nFor the capacity of my ruder powers.\nI fear it much; and I do fear besides\nThat I shall lose distinction in my joys;\nAs doth a battle, when they charge on heaps\nThe enemy flying.\n\n Re-enter Pandarus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nShe\u2019s making her ready, she\u2019ll come straight; you must be witty now.\nShe does so blush, and fetches her wind so short, as if she were fray\u2019d\nwith a sprite. I\u2019ll fetch her. It is the prettiest villain; she fetches\nher breath as short as a new-ta\u2019en sparrow.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nTROILUS.\nEven such a passion doth embrace my bosom.\nMy heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse,\nAnd all my powers do their bestowing lose,\nLike vassalage at unawares encount\u2019ring\nThe eye of majesty.\n\n Re-enter Pandarus with Cressida.\n\nPANDARUS.\nCome, come, what need you blush? Shame\u2019s a baby. Here she is now; swear\nthe oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.\u2014What, are you gone\nagain? You must be watch\u2019d ere you be made tame, must you? Come your\nways, come your ways; and you draw backward, we\u2019ll put you i\u2019 th\u2019\nfills. Why do you not speak to her? Come, draw this curtain and let\u2019s\nsee your picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight!\nAnd \u2019twere dark, you\u2019d close sooner. So, so; rub on, and kiss the\nmistress. How now, a kiss in fee-farm! Build there, carpenter; the air\nis sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you. The\nfalcon as the tercel, for all the ducks i\u2019 th\u2019 river. Go to, go to.\n\nTROILUS.\nYou have bereft me of all words, lady.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWords pay no debts, give her deeds; but she\u2019ll bereave you o\u2019 th\u2019 deeds\ntoo, if she call your activity in question. What, billing again? Here\u2019s\n\u2018In witness whereof the parties interchangeably.\u2019 Come in, come in;\nI\u2019ll go get a fire.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWill you walk in, my lord?\n\nTROILUS.\nO Cressid, how often have I wish\u2019d me thus!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWish\u2019d, my lord! The gods grant\u2014O my lord!\n\nTROILUS.\nWhat should they grant? What makes this pretty abruption? What too\ncurious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nMore dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.\n\nTROILUS.\nFears make devils of cherubins; they never see truly.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBlind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer footing than blind\nreason stumbling without fear. To fear the worst oft cures the worse.\n\nTROILUS.\nO, let my lady apprehend no fear! In all Cupid\u2019s pageant there is\npresented no monster.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNor nothing monstrous neither?\n\nTROILUS.\nNothing, but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas, live in fire,\neat rocks, tame tigers; thinking it harder for our mistress to devise\nimposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed. This\nis the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will is infinite, and the\nexecution confin\u2019d; that the desire is boundless, and the act a slave\nto limit.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThey say all lovers swear more performance than they are able, and yet\nreserve an ability that they never perform; vowing more than the\nperfection of ten, and discharging less than the tenth part of one.\nThey that have the voice of lions and the act of hares, are they not\nmonsters?\n\nTROILUS.\nAre there such? Such are not we. Praise us as we are tasted, allow us\nas we prove; our head shall go bare till merit crown it. No perfection\nin reversion shall have a praise in present. We will not name desert\nbefore his birth; and, being born, his addition shall be humble. Few\nwords to fair faith: Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can\nsay worst shall be a mock for his truth; and what truth can speak\ntruest not truer than Troilus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWill you walk in, my lord?\n\n Re-enter Pandarus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat, blushing still? Have you not done talking yet?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWell, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI thank you for that; if my lord get a boy of you, you\u2019ll give him me.\nBe true to my lord; if he flinch, chide me for it.\n\nTROILUS.\nYou know now your hostages: your uncle\u2019s word and my firm faith.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNay, I\u2019ll give my word for her too: our kindred, though they be long\nere they are wooed, they are constant being won; they are burs, I can\ntell you; they\u2019ll stick where they are thrown.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBoldness comes to me now and brings me heart.\nPrince Troilus, I have lov\u2019d you night and day\nFor many weary months.\n\nTROILUS.\nWhy was my Cressid then so hard to win?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHard to seem won; but I was won, my lord,\nWith the first glance that ever\u2014pardon me.\nIf I confess much, you will play the tyrant.\nI love you now; but till now not so much\nBut I might master it. In faith, I lie;\nMy thoughts were like unbridled children, grown\nToo headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!\nWhy have I blabb\u2019d? Who shall be true to us,\nWhen we are so unsecret to ourselves?\nBut, though I lov\u2019d you well, I woo\u2019d you not;\nAnd yet, good faith, I wish\u2019d myself a man,\nOr that we women had men\u2019s privilege\nOf speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,\nFor in this rapture I shall surely speak\nThe thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,\nCunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws\nMy very soul of counsel. Stop my mouth.\n\nTROILUS.\nAnd shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.\n\nPANDARUS.\nPretty, i\u2019 faith.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nMy lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;\n\u2019Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.\nI am asham\u2019d. O heavens! what have I done?\nFor this time will I take my leave, my lord.\n\nTROILUS.\nYour leave, sweet Cressid!\n\nPANDARUS.\nLeave! And you take leave till tomorrow morning\u2014\n\nCRESSIDA.\nPray you, content you.\n\nTROILUS.\nWhat offends you, lady?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSir, mine own company.\n\nTROILUS.\nYou cannot shun yourself.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nLet me go and try.\nI have a kind of self resides with you;\nBut an unkind self, that itself will leave\nTo be another\u2019s fool. I would be gone.\nWhere is my wit? I know not what I speak.\n\nTROILUS.\nWell know they what they speak that speak so wisely.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nPerchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;\nAnd fell so roundly to a large confession\nTo angle for your thoughts; but you are wise\u2014\nOr else you love not; for to be wise and love\nExceeds man\u2019s might; that dwells with gods above.\n\nTROILUS.\nO that I thought it could be in a woman\u2014\nAs, if it can, I will presume in you\u2014\nTo feed for aye her lamp and flames of love;\nTo keep her constancy in plight and youth,\nOutliving beauty\u2019s outward, with a mind\nThat doth renew swifter than blood decays!\nOr that persuasion could but thus convince me\nThat my integrity and truth to you\nMight be affronted with the match and weight\nOf such a winnowed purity in love.\nHow were I then uplifted! But, alas,\nI am as true as truth\u2019s simplicity,\nAnd simpler than the infancy of truth.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIn that I\u2019ll war with you.\n\nTROILUS.\nO virtuous fight,\nWhen right with right wars who shall be most right!\nTrue swains in love shall in the world to come\nApprove their truth by Troilus, when their rhymes,\nFull of protest, of oath, and big compare,\nWant similes, truth tir\u2019d with iteration\u2014\nAs true as steel, as plantage to the moon,\nAs sun to day, as turtle to her mate,\nAs iron to adamant, as earth to th\u2019 centre\u2014\nYet, after all comparisons of truth,\nAs truth\u2019s authentic author to be cited,\n\u2018As true as Troilus\u2019 shall crown up the verse\nAnd sanctify the numbers.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nProphet may you be!\nIf I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,\nWhen time is old and hath forgot itself,\nWhen waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,\nAnd blind oblivion swallow\u2019d cities up,\nAnd mighty states characterless are grated\nTo dusty nothing\u2014yet let memory\nFrom false to false, among false maids in love,\nUpbraid my falsehood when th\u2019 have said \u2018As false\nAs air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,\nAs fox to lamb, or wolf to heifer\u2019s calf,\nPard to the hind, or stepdame to her son\u2019\u2014\nYea, let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,\n\u2018As false as Cressid.\u2019\n\nPANDARUS.\nGo to, a bargain made; seal it, seal it; I\u2019ll be the witness. Here I\nhold your hand; here my cousin\u2019s. If ever you prove false one to\nanother, since I have taken such pains to bring you together, let all\npitiful goers-between be call\u2019d to the world\u2019s end after my name\u2014call\nthem all Pandars; let all constant men be Troiluses, all false women\nCressids, and all brokers between Pandars. Say \u2018Amen.\u2019\n\nTROILUS.\nAmen.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAmen.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAmen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber and a bed; which bed, because\nit shall not speak of your pretty encounters, press it to death. Away!\n\n [_Exeunt Troilus and Cressida_.]\n\nAnd Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here,\nBed, chamber, pander, to provide this gear!\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nSCENE III. The Greek camp.\n\n Flourish. Enter Agamemnon, Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor, Ajax, Menelaus\n and Calchas.\n\nCALCHAS.\nNow, Princes, for the service I have done,\nTh\u2019advantage of the time prompts me aloud\nTo call for recompense. Appear it to your mind\nThat, through the sight I bear in things to come,\nI have abandon\u2019d Troy, left my possession,\nIncurr\u2019d a traitor\u2019s name, expos\u2019d myself\nFrom certain and possess\u2019d conveniences\nTo doubtful fortunes, sequest\u2019ring from me all\nThat time, acquaintance, custom, and condition,\nMade tame and most familiar to my nature;\nAnd here, to do you service, am become\nAs new into the world, strange, unacquainted\u2014\nI do beseech you, as in way of taste,\nTo give me now a little benefit\nOut of those many regist\u2019red in promise,\nWhich you say live to come in my behalf.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat wouldst thou of us, Trojan? Make demand.\n\nCALCHAS.\nYou have a Trojan prisoner call\u2019d Antenor,\nYesterday took; Troy holds him very dear.\nOft have you\u2014often have you thanks therefore\u2014\nDesir\u2019d my Cressid in right great exchange,\nWhom Troy hath still denied; but this Antenor,\nI know, is such a wrest in their affairs\nThat their negotiations all must slack\nWanting his manage; and they will almost\nGive us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,\nIn change of him. Let him be sent, great Princes,\nAnd he shall buy my daughter; and her presence\nShall quite strike off all service I have done\nIn most accepted pain.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nLet Diomedes bear him,\nAnd bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have\nWhat he requests of us. Good Diomed,\nFurnish you fairly for this interchange;\nWithal, bring word if Hector will tomorrow\nBe answer\u2019d in his challenge. Ajax is ready.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nThis shall I undertake; and \u2019tis a burden\nWhich I am proud to bear.\n\n [_Exeunt Diomedes and Calchas_.]\n\n [_Achilles and Patroclus stand in their tent_.]\n\nULYSSES.\nAchilles stands i\u2019 th\u2019entrance of his tent.\nPlease it our general pass strangely by him,\nAs if he were forgot; and, Princes all,\nLay negligent and loose regard upon him.\nI will come last. \u2019Tis like he\u2019ll question me\nWhy such unplausive eyes are bent, why turn\u2019d on him.\nIf so, I have derision med\u2019cinable\nTo use between your strangeness and his pride,\nWhich his own will shall have desire to drink.\nIt may do good. Pride hath no other glass\nTo show itself but pride; for supple knees\nFeed arrogance and are the proud man\u2019s fees.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWe\u2019ll execute your purpose, and put on\nA form of strangeness as we pass along.\nSo do each lord; and either greet him not,\nOr else disdainfully, which shall shake him more\nThan if not look\u2019d on. I will lead the way.\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat comes the general to speak with me?\nYou know my mind. I\u2019ll fight no more \u2019gainst Troy.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat says Achilles? Would he aught with us?\n\nNESTOR.\nWould you, my lord, aught with the general?\n\nACHILLES.\nNo.\n\nNESTOR.\nNothing, my lord.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nThe better.\n\n [_Exeunt Agamemnon and Nestor_.]\n\nACHILLES.\nGood day, good day.\n\nMENELAUS.\nHow do you? How do you?\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat, does the cuckold scorn me?\n\nAJAX.\nHow now, Patroclus?\n\nACHILLES.\nGood morrow, Ajax.\n\nAJAX.\nHa?\n\nACHILLES.\nGood morrow.\n\nAJAX.\nAy, and good next day too.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nThey pass by strangely. They were us\u2019d to bend,\nTo send their smiles before them to Achilles,\nTo come as humbly as they us\u2019d to creep\nTo holy altars.\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat, am I poor of late?\n\u2019Tis certain, greatness, once fall\u2019n out with fortune,\nMust fall out with men too. What the declin\u2019d is,\nHe shall as soon read in the eyes of others\nAs feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,\nShow not their mealy wings but to the summer;\nAnd not a man for being simply man\nHath any honour, but honour for those honours\nThat are without him, as place, riches, and favour,\nPrizes of accident, as oft as merit;\nWhich when they fall, as being slippery standers,\nThe love that lean\u2019d on them as slippery too,\nDoth one pluck down another, and together\nDie in the fall. But \u2019tis not so with me:\nFortune and I are friends; I do enjoy\nAt ample point all that I did possess\nSave these men\u2019s looks; who do, methinks, find out\nSomething not worth in me such rich beholding\nAs they have often given. Here is Ulysses.\nI\u2019ll interrupt his reading.\nHow now, Ulysses!\n\nULYSSES.\nNow, great Thetis\u2019 son!\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat are you reading?\n\nULYSSES.\nA strange fellow here\nWrites me that man\u2014how dearly ever parted,\nHow much in having, or without or in\u2014\nCannot make boast to have that which he hath,\nNor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;\nAs when his virtues shining upon others\nHeat them, and they retort that heat again\nTo the first giver.\n\nACHILLES.\nThis is not strange, Ulysses.\nThe beauty that is borne here in the face\nThe bearer knows not, but commends itself\nTo others\u2019 eyes; nor doth the eye itself\u2014\nThat most pure spirit of sense\u2014behold itself,\nNot going from itself; but eye to eye opposed\nSalutes each other with each other\u2019s form;\nFor speculation turns not to itself\nTill it hath travell\u2019d, and is mirror\u2019d there\nWhere it may see itself. This is not strange at all.\n\nULYSSES.\nI do not strain at the position\u2014\nIt is familiar\u2014but at the author\u2019s drift;\nWho, in his circumstance, expressly proves\nThat no man is the lord of anything,\nThough in and of him there be much consisting,\nTill he communicate his parts to others;\nNor doth he of himself know them for aught\nTill he behold them formed in the applause\nWhere th\u2019are extended; who, like an arch, reverb\u2019rate\nThe voice again; or, like a gate of steel\nFronting the sun, receives and renders back\nHis figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this;\nAnd apprehended here immediately\nTh\u2019unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!\nA very horse that has he knows not what!\nNature, what things there are\nMost abject in regard and dear in use!\nWhat things again most dear in the esteem\nAnd poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow\u2014\nAn act that very chance doth throw upon him\u2014\nAjax renown\u2019d. O heavens, what some men do,\nWhile some men leave to do!\nHow some men creep in skittish Fortune\u2019s hall,\nWhiles others play the idiots in her eyes!\nHow one man eats into another\u2019s pride,\nWhile pride is fasting in his wantonness!\nTo see these Grecian lords!\u2014why, even already\nThey clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,\nAs if his foot were on brave Hector\u2019s breast,\nAnd great Troy shrieking.\n\nACHILLES.\nI do believe it; for they pass\u2019d by me\nAs misers do by beggars, neither gave to me\nGood word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?\n\nULYSSES.\nTime hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,\nWherein he puts alms for oblivion,\nA great-siz\u2019d monster of ingratitudes.\nThose scraps are good deeds past, which are devour\u2019d\nAs fast as they are made, forgot as soon\nAs done. Perseverance, dear my lord,\nKeeps honour bright. To have done is to hang\nQuite out of fashion, like a rusty mail\nIn monumental mock\u2019ry. Take the instant way;\nFor honour travels in a strait so narrow\u2014\nWhere one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,\nFor emulation hath a thousand sons\nThat one by one pursue; if you give way,\nOr hedge aside from the direct forthright,\nLike to an ent\u2019red tide they all rush by\nAnd leave you hindmost;\nOr, like a gallant horse fall\u2019n in first rank,\nLie there for pavement to the abject rear,\nO\u2019er-run and trampled on. Then what they do in present,\nThough less than yours in past, must o\u2019ertop yours;\nFor Time is like a fashionable host,\nThat slightly shakes his parting guest by th\u2019hand;\nAnd with his arms out-stretch\u2019d, as he would fly,\nGrasps in the comer. The welcome ever smiles,\nAnd farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek\nRemuneration for the thing it was;\nFor beauty, wit,\nHigh birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,\nLove, friendship, charity, are subjects all\nTo envious and calumniating Time.\nOne touch of nature makes the whole world kin\u2014\nThat all with one consent praise new-born gauds,\nThough they are made and moulded of things past,\nAnd give to dust that is a little gilt\nMore laud than gilt o\u2019er-dusted.\nThe present eye praises the present object.\nThen marvel not, thou great and complete man,\nThat all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,\nSince things in motion sooner catch the eye\nThan what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,\nAnd still it might, and yet it may again,\nIf thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive\nAnd case thy reputation in thy tent,\nWhose glorious deeds but in these fields of late\nMade emulous missions \u2019mongst the gods themselves,\nAnd drave great Mars to faction.\n\nACHILLES.\nOf this my privacy\nI have strong reasons.\n\nULYSSES.\nBut \u2019gainst your privacy\nThe reasons are more potent and heroical.\n\u2019Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love\nWith one of Priam\u2019s daughters.\n\nACHILLES.\nHa! known!\n\nULYSSES.\nIs that a wonder?\nThe providence that\u2019s in a watchful state\nKnows almost every grain of Plutus\u2019 gold;\nFinds bottom in th\u2019uncomprehensive deeps;\nKeeps place with thought, and almost, like the gods,\nDo thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.\nThere is a mystery\u2014with whom relation\nDurst never meddle\u2014in the soul of state,\nWhich hath an operation more divine\nThan breath or pen can give expressure to.\nAll the commerce that you have had with Troy\nAs perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;\nAnd better would it fit Achilles much\nTo throw down Hector than Polyxena.\nBut it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,\nWhen fame shall in our island sound her trump,\nAnd all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing\n\u2018Great Hector\u2019s sister did Achilles win;\nBut our great Ajax bravely beat down him.\u2019\nFarewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.\nThe fool slides o\u2019er the ice that you should break.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nPATROCLUS.\nTo this effect, Achilles, have I mov\u2019d you.\nA woman impudent and mannish grown\nIs not more loath\u2019d than an effeminate man\nIn time of action. I stand condemn\u2019d for this;\nThey think my little stomach to the war\nAnd your great love to me restrains you thus.\nSweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid\nShall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,\nAnd, like a dew-drop from the lion\u2019s mane,\nBe shook to air.\n\nACHILLES.\nShall Ajax fight with Hector?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nAy, and perhaps receive much honour by him.\n\nACHILLES.\nI see my reputation is at stake;\nMy fame is shrewdly gor\u2019d.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nO, then, beware:\nThose wounds heal ill that men do give themselves;\nOmission to do what is necessary\nSeals a commission to a blank of danger;\nAnd danger, like an ague, subtly taints\nEven then when they sit idly in the sun.\n\nACHILLES.\nGo call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.\nI\u2019ll send the fool to Ajax, and desire him\nT\u2019invite the Trojan lords, after the combat,\nTo see us here unarm\u2019d. I have a woman\u2019s longing,\nAn appetite that I am sick withal,\nTo see great Hector in his weeds of peace;\nTo talk with him, and to behold his visage,\nEven to my full of view.\n\n Enter Thersites.\n\nA labour sav\u2019d!\n\nTHERSITES.\nA wonder!\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat?\n\nTHERSITES.\nAjax goes up and down the field asking for himself.\n\nACHILLES.\nHow so?\n\nTHERSITES.\nHe must fight singly tomorrow with Hector, and is so prophetically\nproud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing.\n\nACHILLES.\nHow can that be?\n\nTHERSITES.\nWhy, a\u2019 stalks up and down like a peacock\u2014a stride and a stand;\nruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set\ndown her reckoning, bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should\nsay \u2018There were wit in this head, and \u2019twould out\u2019; and so there is;\nbut it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show\nwithout knocking. The man\u2019s undone for ever; for if Hector break not\nhis neck i\u2019 th\u2019 combat, he\u2019ll break\u2019t himself in vainglory. He knows\nnot me. I said \u2018Good morrow, Ajax\u2019; and he replies \u2018Thanks, Agamemnon.\u2019\nWhat think you of this man that takes me for the general? He\u2019s grown a\nvery land fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! A man may\nwear it on both sides, like leather jerkin.\n\nACHILLES.\nThou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.\n\nTHERSITES.\nWho, I? Why, he\u2019ll answer nobody; he professes not answering. Speaking\nis for beggars: he wears his tongue in\u2019s arms. I will put on his\npresence. Let Patroclus make his demands to me, you shall see the\npageant of Ajax.\n\nACHILLES.\nTo him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite\nthe most valorous Hector to come unarm\u2019d to my tent; and to procure\nsafe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious\nsix-or-seven-times-honour\u2019d Captain General of the Grecian army,\nAgamemnon. Do this.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nJove bless great Ajax!\n\nTHERSITES.\nHum!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nI come from the worthy Achilles\u2014\n\nTHERSITES.\nHa!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWho most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent\u2014\n\nTHERSITES.\nHum!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nAnd to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon.\n\nTHERSITES.\nAgamemnon?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nAy, my lord.\n\nTHERSITES.\nHa!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWhat you say to\u2019t?\n\nTHERSITES.\nGod buy you, with all my heart.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nYour answer, sir.\n\nTHERSITES.\nIf tomorrow be a fair day, by eleven of the clock it will go one way or\nother. Howsoever, he shall pay for me ere he has me.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nYour answer, sir.\n\nTHERSITES.\nFare ye well, with all my heart.\n\nACHILLES.\nWhy, but he is not in this tune, is he?\n\nTHERSITES.\nNo, but out of tune thus. What music will be in him when Hector has\nknock\u2019d out his brains, I know not; but, I am sure, none; unless the\nfiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.\n\nACHILLES.\nCome, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.\n\nTHERSITES.\nLet me bear another to his horse; for that\u2019s the more capable creature.\n\nACHILLES.\nMy mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr\u2019d;\nAnd I myself see not the bottom of it.\n\n [_Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus_.]\n\nTHERSITES.\nWould the fountain of your mind were clear again, that I might water an\nass at it. I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant\nignorance.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\n\n\nACT IV.\n\nSCENE I. Troy. A street.\n\n Enter, at one side, Aeneas and servant with a torch; at another Paris,\n Deiphobus, Antenor, Diomedes the Grecian, and others, with torches.\n\nPARIS.\nSee, ho! Who is that there?\n\nDEIPHOBUS.\nIt is the Lord Aeneas.\n\nAENEAS.\nIs the Prince there in person?\nHad I so good occasion to lie long\nAs you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business\nShould rob my bed-mate of my company.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nThat\u2019s my mind too. Good morrow, Lord Aeneas.\n\nPARIS.\nA valiant Greek, Aeneas\u2014take his hand:\nWitness the process of your speech, wherein\nYou told how Diomed, a whole week by days,\nDid haunt you in the field.\n\nAENEAS.\nHealth to you, valiant sir,\nDuring all question of the gentle truce;\nBut when I meet you arm\u2019d, as black defiance\nAs heart can think or courage execute.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nThe one and other Diomed embraces.\nOur bloods are now in calm; and so long health!\nBut when contention and occasion meet,\nBy Jove, I\u2019ll play the hunter for thy life\nWith all my force, pursuit, and policy.\n\nAENEAS.\nAnd thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly\nWith his face backward. In humane gentleness,\nWelcome to Troy! Now, by Anchises\u2019 life,\nWelcome indeed! By Venus\u2019 hand I swear\nNo man alive can love in such a sort\nThe thing he means to kill, more excellently.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nWe sympathise. Jove let Aeneas live,\nIf to my sword his fate be not the glory,\nA thousand complete courses of the sun!\nBut in mine emulous honour let him die\nWith every joint a wound, and that tomorrow!\n\nAENEAS.\nWe know each other well.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nWe do; and long to know each other worse.\n\nPARIS.\nThis is the most despiteful gentle greeting\nThe noblest hateful love, that e\u2019er I heard of.\nWhat business, lord, so early?\n\nAENEAS.\nI was sent for to the King; but why, I know not.\n\nPARIS.\nHis purpose meets you: \u2019twas to bring this Greek\nTo Calchas\u2019 house, and there to render him,\nFor the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid.\nLet\u2019s have your company; or, if you please,\nHaste there before us. I constantly believe\u2014\nOr rather call my thought a certain knowledge\u2014\nMy brother Troilus lodges there tonight.\nRouse him and give him note of our approach,\nWith the whole quality wherefore; I fear\nWe shall be much unwelcome.\n\nAENEAS.\nThat I assure you:\nTroilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece\nThan Cressid borne from Troy.\n\nPARIS.\nThere is no help;\nThe bitter disposition of the time\nWill have it so. On, lord; we\u2019ll follow you.\n\nAENEAS.\nGood morrow, all.\n\n [_Exit with servant_.]\n\nPARIS.\nAnd tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,\nEven in the soul of sound good-fellowship,\nWho in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best,\nMyself, or Menelaus?\n\nDIOMEDES.\nBoth alike:\nHe merits well to have her that doth seek her,\nNot making any scruple of her soilure,\nWith such a hell of pain and world of charge;\nAnd you as well to keep her that defend her,\nNot palating the taste of her dishonour,\nWith such a costly loss of wealth and friends.\nHe like a puling cuckold would drink up\nThe lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;\nYou, like a lecher, out of whorish loins\nAre pleas\u2019d to breed out your inheritors.\nBoth merits pois\u2019d, each weighs nor less nor more,\nBut he as he, the heavier for a whore.\n\nPARIS.\nYou are too bitter to your country-woman.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nShe\u2019s bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris:\nFor every false drop in her bawdy veins\nA Grecian\u2019s life hath sunk; for every scruple\nOf her contaminated carrion weight\nA Trojan hath been slain. Since she could speak,\nShe hath not given so many good words breath\nAs for her Greeks and Trojans suff\u2019red death.\n\nPARIS.\nFair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,\nDispraise the thing that you desire to buy;\nBut we in silence hold this virtue well,\nWe\u2019ll not commend what we intend to sell.\nHere lies our way.\n\n [_Exeunt_.]\n\nSCENE II. Troy. The court of PANDARUS\u2019 house.\n\n Enter Troilus and Cressida.\n\nTROILUS.\nDear, trouble not yourself; the morn is cold.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThen, sweet my lord, I\u2019ll call mine uncle down;\nHe shall unbolt the gates.\n\nTROILUS.\nTrouble him not;\nTo bed, to bed! Sleep kill those pretty eyes,\nAnd give as soft attachment to thy senses\nAs infants empty of all thought!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nGood morrow, then.\n\nTROILUS.\nI prithee now, to bed.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAre you aweary of me?\n\nTROILUS.\nO Cressida! but that the busy day,\nWak\u2019d by the lark, hath rous\u2019d the ribald crows,\nAnd dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,\nI would not from thee.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNight hath been too brief.\n\nTROILUS.\nBeshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays\nAs tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love\nWith wings more momentary-swift than thought.\nYou will catch cold, and curse me.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nPrithee tarry.\nYou men will never tarry.\nO foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,\nAnd then you would have tarried. Hark! there\u2019s one up.\n\nPANDARUS.\n[_Within._] What\u2019s all the doors open here?\n\nTROILUS.\nIt is your uncle.\n\n Enter Pandarus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nA pestilence on him! Now will he be mocking.\nI shall have such a life!\n\nPANDARUS.\nHow now, how now! How go maidenheads?\nHere, you maid! Where\u2019s my cousin Cressid?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nGo hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle.\nYou bring me to do, and then you flout me too.\n\nPANDARUS.\nTo do what? to do what? Let her say what.\nWhat have I brought you to do?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nCome, come, beshrew your heart! You\u2019ll ne\u2019er be good, nor suffer\nothers.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHa, ha! Alas, poor wretch! Ah, poor capocchia! Hast not slept tonight?\nWould he not, a naughty man, let it sleep? A bugbear take him!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nDid not I tell you? Would he were knock\u2019d i\u2019 th\u2019 head!\n\n [_One knocks_.]\n\nWho\u2019s that at door? Good uncle, go and see.\nMy lord, come you again into my chamber.\nYou smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.\n\nTROILUS.\nHa! ha!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nCome, you are deceiv\u2019d, I think of no such thing.\n\n [_Knock_.]\n\nHow earnestly they knock! Pray you come in:\nI would not for half Troy have you seen here.\n\n [_Exeunt Troilus and Cressida_.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nWho\u2019s there? What\u2019s the matter? Will you beat down the door? How now?\nWhat\u2019s the matter?\n\n Enter Aeneas.\n\nAENEAS.\nGood morrow, lord, good morrow.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWho\u2019s there? My lord Aeneas? By my troth,\nI knew you not. What news with you so early?\n\nAENEAS.\nIs not Prince Troilus here?\n\nPANDARUS.\nHere! What should he do here?\n\nAENEAS.\nCome, he is here, my lord; do not deny him.\nIt doth import him much to speak with me.\n\nPANDARUS.\nIs he here, say you? It\u2019s more than I know, I\u2019ll be sworn. For my own\npart, I came in late. What should he do here?\n\nAENEAS.\nWho, nay then! Come, come, you\u2019ll do him wrong ere you are ware; you\u2019ll\nbe so true to him to be false to him. Do not you know of him, but yet\ngo fetch him hither; go.\n\n Re-enter Troilus.\n\nTROILUS.\nHow now! What\u2019s the matter?\n\nAENEAS.\nMy lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,\nMy matter is so rash. There is at hand\nParis your brother, and Deiphobus,\nThe Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor\nDeliver\u2019d to us; and for him forthwith,\nEre the first sacrifice, within this hour,\nWe must give up to Diomedes\u2019 hand\nThe Lady Cressida.\n\nTROILUS.\nIs it so concluded?\n\nAENEAS.\nBy Priam and the general state of Troy.\nThey are at hand, and ready to effect it.\n\nTROILUS.\nHow my achievements mock me!\nI will go meet them; and, my Lord Aeneas,\nWe met by chance; you did not find me here.\n\nAENEAS.\nGood, good, my lord, the secrets of neighbour Pandar\nHave not more gift in taciturnity.\n\n [_Exeunt Troilus and Aeneas_.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nIs\u2019t possible? No sooner got but lost? The devil take Antenor! The\nyoung prince will go mad. A plague upon Antenor! I would they had\nbroke\u2019s neck.\n\n Re-enter Cressida.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHow now! What\u2019s the matter? Who was here?\n\nPANDARUS.\nAh, ah!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhy sigh you so profoundly? Where\u2019s my lord? Gone? Tell me, sweet\nuncle, what\u2019s the matter?\n\nPANDARUS.\nWould I were as deep under the earth as I am above!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO the gods! What\u2019s the matter?\n\nPANDARUS.\nPray thee get thee in. Would thou hadst ne\u2019er been born! I knew thou\nwouldst be his death! O, poor gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nGood uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I beseech you, what\u2019s the\nmatter?\n\nPANDARUS.\nThou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou art chang\u2019d for\nAntenor; thou must to thy father, and be gone from Troilus. \u2019Twill be\nhis death; \u2019twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO you immortal gods! I will not go.\n\nPANDARUS.\nThou must.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nI will not, uncle. I have forgot my father;\nI know no touch of consanguinity,\nNo kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me\nAs the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine,\nMake Cressid\u2019s name the very crown of falsehood,\nIf ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,\nDo to this body what extremes you can,\nBut the strong base and building of my love\nIs as the very centre of the earth,\nDrawing all things to it. I\u2019ll go in and weep\u2014\n\nPANDARUS.\nDo, do.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nTear my bright hair, and scratch my praised cheeks,\nCrack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart,\nWith sounding \u2018Troilus.\u2019 I will not go from Troy.\n\n [_Exeunt_.]\n\nSCENE III. Troy. A street before PANDARUS\u2019 house.\n\n Enter Paris, Troilus, Aeneas, Deiphobus, Antenor and Diomedes.\n\nPARIS.\nIt is great morning; and the hour prefix\u2019d\nFor her delivery to this valiant Greek\nComes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,\nTell you the lady what she is to do\nAnd haste her to the purpose.\n\nTROILUS.\nWalk into her house.\nI\u2019ll bring her to the Grecian presently;\nAnd to his hand when I deliver her,\nThink it an altar, and thy brother Troilus\nA priest, there off\u2019ring to it his own heart.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nPARIS.\nI know what \u2019tis to love,\nAnd would, as I shall pity, I could help!\nPlease you walk in, my lords?\n\n [_Exeunt_.]\n\nSCENE IV. Troy. PANDARUS\u2019 house.\n\n Enter Pandarus and Cressida.\n\nPANDARUS.\nBe moderate, be moderate.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhy tell you me of moderation?\nThe grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,\nAnd violenteth in a sense as strong\nAs that which causeth it. How can I moderate it?\nIf I could temporize with my affections\nOr brew it to a weak and colder palate,\nThe like allayment could I give my grief.\nMy love admits no qualifying dross;\nNo more my grief, in such a precious loss.\n\n Enter Troilus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHere, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet ducks!\n\nCRESSIDA.\n[_Embracing him_.] O Troilus! Troilus!\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat a pair of spectacles is here! Let me embrace too. \u2018O heart,\u2019 as\nthe goodly saying is,\u2014\n\n  O heart, heavy heart,\n  Why sigh\u2019st thou without breaking?\n\nwhere he answers again\n\n  Because thou canst not ease thy smart\n  By friendship nor by speaking.\n\nThere was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away nothing, for we may\nlive to have need of such a verse. We see it, we see it. How now,\nlambs!\n\nTROILUS.\nCressid, I love thee in so strain\u2019d a purity\nThat the bless\u2019d gods, as angry with my fancy,\nMore bright in zeal than the devotion which\nCold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHave the gods envy?\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, ay, ay, ay; \u2019tis too plain a case.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAnd is it true that I must go from Troy?\n\nTROILUS.\nA hateful truth.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhat! and from Troilus too?\n\nTROILUS.\nFrom Troy and Troilus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIs\u2019t possible?\n\nTROILUS.\nAnd suddenly; where injury of chance\nPuts back leave-taking, justles roughly by\nAll time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips\nOf all rejoindure, forcibly prevents\nOur lock\u2019d embrasures, strangles our dear vows\nEven in the birth of our own labouring breath.\nWe two, that with so many thousand sighs\nDid buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves\nWith the rude brevity and discharge of one.\nInjurious time now with a robber\u2019s haste\nCrams his rich thiev\u2019ry up, he knows not how.\nAs many farewells as be stars in heaven,\nWith distinct breath and consign\u2019d kisses to them,\nHe fumbles up into a loose adieu,\nAnd scants us with a single famish\u2019d kiss,\nDistasted with the salt of broken tears.\n\nAENEAS.\n[_Within_.] My lord, is the lady ready?\n\nTROILUS.\nHark! you are call\u2019d. Some say the Genius\nCries so to him that instantly must die.\nBid them have patience; she shall come anon.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhere are my tears? Rain, to lay this wind, or my heart will be blown\nup by my throat!\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nI must then to the Grecians?\n\nTROILUS.\nNo remedy.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nA woeful Cressid \u2019mongst the merry Greeks!\nWhen shall we see again?\n\nTROILUS.\nHear me, my love. Be thou but true of heart.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nI true? How now! What wicked deem is this?\n\nTROILUS.\nNay, we must use expostulation kindly,\nFor it is parting from us.\nI speak not \u2018Be thou true\u2019 as fearing thee,\nFor I will throw my glove to Death himself\nThat there\u2019s no maculation in thy heart;\nBut \u2018Be thou true\u2019 say I to fashion in\nMy sequent protestation: be thou true,\nAnd I will see thee.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO! you shall be expos\u2019d, my lord, to dangers\nAs infinite as imminent! But I\u2019ll be true.\n\nTROILUS.\nAnd I\u2019ll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAnd you this glove. When shall I see you?\n\nTROILUS.\nI will corrupt the Grecian sentinels\nTo give thee nightly visitation.\nBut yet be true.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO heavens! \u2018Be true\u2019 again!\n\nTROILUS.\nHear why I speak it, love.\nThe Grecian youths are full of quality;\nThey\u2019re loving, well compos\u2019d, with gifts of nature,\nFlowing and swelling o\u2019er with arts and exercise.\nHow novelty may move, and parts with person,\nAlas, a kind of godly jealousy,\nWhich, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin,\nMakes me afear\u2019d.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO heavens! you love me not!\n\nTROILUS.\nDie I a villain then!\nIn this I do not call your faith in question\nSo mainly as my merit. I cannot sing,\nNor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,\nNor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,\nTo which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant;\nBut I can tell that in each grace of these\nThere lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil\nThat tempts most cunningly. But be not tempted.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nDo you think I will?\n\nTROILUS.\nNo.\nBut something may be done that we will not;\nAnd sometimes we are devils to ourselves,\nWhen we will tempt the frailty of our powers,\nPresuming on their changeful potency.\n\nAENEAS.\n[_Within_.] Nay, good my lord!\n\nTROILUS.\nCome, kiss; and let us part.\n\nPARIS.\n[_Within_.] Brother Troilus!\n\nTROILUS.\nGood brother, come you hither;\nAnd bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nMy lord, will you be true?\n\nTROILUS.\nWho, I? Alas, it is my vice, my fault!\nWhiles others fish with craft for great opinion,\nI with great truth catch mere simplicity;\nWhilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,\nWith truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.\nFear not my truth: the moral of my wit\nIs plain and true; there\u2019s all the reach of it.\n\n Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor, Deiphobus and Diomedes.\n\nWelcome, Sir Diomed! Here is the lady\nWhich for Antenor we deliver you;\nAt the port, lord, I\u2019ll give her to thy hand,\nAnd by the way possess thee what she is.\nEntreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,\nIf e\u2019er thou stand at mercy of my sword,\nName Cressid, and thy life shall be as safe\nAs Priam is in Ilion.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nFair Lady Cressid,\nSo please you, save the thanks this prince expects.\nThe lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,\nPleads your fair usage; and to Diomed\nYou shall be mistress, and command him wholly.\n\nTROILUS.\nGrecian, thou dost not use me courteously\nTo shame the zeal of my petition to thee\nIn praising her. I tell thee, lord of Greece,\nShe is as far high-soaring o\u2019er thy praises\nAs thou unworthy to be call\u2019d her servant.\nI charge thee use her well, even for my charge;\nFor, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,\nThough the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,\nI\u2019ll cut thy throat.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nO, be not mov\u2019d, Prince Troilus.\nLet me be privileg\u2019d by my place and message\nTo be a speaker free: when I am hence\nI\u2019ll answer to my lust. And know you, lord,\nI\u2019ll nothing do on charge: to her own worth\nShe shall be priz\u2019d. But that you say \u2018Be\u2019t so,\u2019\nI speak it in my spirit and honour, \u2018No.\u2019\n\nTROILUS.\nCome, to the port. I\u2019ll tell thee, Diomed,\nThis brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.\nLady, give me your hand; and, as we walk,\nTo our own selves bend we our needful talk.\n\n [_Exeunt Troilus, Cressida and Diomedes_.]\n\n [_Sound trumpet_.]\n\nPARIS.\nHark! Hector\u2019s trumpet.\n\nAENEAS.\nHow have we spent this morning!\nThe Prince must think me tardy and remiss,\nThat swore to ride before him to the field.\n\nPARIS.\n\u2019Tis Troilus\u2019 fault. Come, come to field with him.\n\nDEIPHOBUS.\nLet us make ready straight.\n\nAENEAS.\nYea, with a bridegroom\u2019s fresh alacrity\nLet us address to tend on Hector\u2019s heels.\nThe glory of our Troy doth this day lie\nOn his fair worth and single chivalry.\n\n [_Exeunt_.]\n\nSCENE V.

That spirit of his\nIn aspiration lifts him from the earth.\n\n Enter Diomedes and Cressida.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nIs this the Lady Cressid?\n\nDIOMEDES.\nEven she.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nMost dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.\n\nNESTOR.\nOur general doth salute you with a kiss.\n\nULYSSES.\nYet is the kindness but particular;\n\u2019Twere better she were kiss\u2019d in general.\n\nNESTOR.\nAnd very courtly counsel: I\u2019ll begin.\nSo much for Nestor.\n\nACHILLES.\nI\u2019ll take that winter from your lips, fair lady.\nAchilles bids you welcome.\n\nMENELAUS.\nI had good argument for kissing once.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nBut that\u2019s no argument for kissing now;\nFor thus popp\u2019d Paris in his hardiment,\nAnd parted thus you and your argument.\n\nULYSSES.\nO deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!\nFor which we lose our heads to gild his horns.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nThe first was Menelaus\u2019 kiss; this, mine:\nPatroclus kisses you.\n\nMENELAUS.\nO, this is trim!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nParis and I kiss evermore for him.\n\nMENELAUS.\nI\u2019ll have my kiss, sir.

Every man is odd.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNo, Paris is not; for you know \u2019tis true\nThat you are odd, and he is even with you.\n\nMENELAUS.\nYou fillip me o\u2019 th\u2019head.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNo, I\u2019ll be sworn.\n\nULYSSES.\nIt were no match, your nail against his horn.\nMay I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nYou may.\n\nULYSSES.\nI do desire it.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhy, beg then.\n\nULYSSES.\nWhy then, for Venus\u2019 sake give me a kiss\nWhen Helen is a maid again, and his.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nI am your debtor; claim it when \u2019tis due.\n\nULYSSES.\nNever\u2019s my day, and then a kiss of you.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nLady, a word.

Set them down\nFor sluttish spoils of opportunity,\nAnd daughters of the game.\n\n [_Trumpet within_.]\n\nALL.\nThe Trojans\u2019 trumpet.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nYonder comes the troop.\n\n Enter Hector, armed; Aeneas, Troilus, Paris, Deiphobus and other\nTrojans, with attendants.\n\nAENEAS.\nHail, all you state of Greece! What shall be done\nTo him that victory commands? Or do you purpose\nA victor shall be known? Will you the knights\nShall to the edge of all extremity\nPursue each other, or shall be divided\nBy any voice or order of the field?\nHector bade ask.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhich way would Hector have it?\n\nAENEAS.\nHe cares not; he\u2019ll obey conditions.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\n\u2019Tis done like Hector.\n\nACHILLES.\nBut securely done,\nA little proudly, and great deal misprising\nThe knight oppos\u2019d.\n\nAENEAS.\nIf not Achilles, sir,\nWhat is your name?\n\nACHILLES.\nIf not Achilles, nothing.\n\nAENEAS.\nTherefore Achilles. But whate\u2019er, know this:\nIn the extremity of great and little\nValour and pride excel themselves in Hector;\nThe one almost as infinite as all,\nThe other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,\nAnd that which looks like pride is courtesy.\nThis Ajax is half made of Hector\u2019s blood;\nIn love whereof half Hector stays at home;\nHalf heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek\nThis blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.\n\nACHILLES.\nA maiden battle then? O! I perceive you.\n\n Re-enter Diomedes.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nHere is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,\nStand by our Ajax. As you and Lord Aeneas\nConsent upon the order of their fight,\nSo be it; either to the uttermost,\nOr else a breath. The combatants being kin\nHalf stints their strife before their strokes begin.\n\nAjax and Hector enter the lists.\n\nULYSSES.\nThey are oppos\u2019d already.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?\n\nULYSSES.\nThe youngest son of Priam, a true knight;\nNot yet mature, yet matchless; firm of word;\nSpeaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;\nNot soon provok\u2019d, nor being provok\u2019d soon calm\u2019d;\nHis heart and hand both open and both free;\nFor what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,\nYet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty,\nNor dignifies an impure thought with breath;\nManly as Hector, but more dangerous;\nFor Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes\nTo tender objects, but he in heat of action\nIs more vindicative than jealous love.\nThey call him Troilus, and on him erect\nA second hope as fairly built as Hector.\nThus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth\nEven to his inches, and, with private soul,\nDid in great Ilion thus translate him to me.\n\n [_Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight._]\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nThey are in action.\n\nNESTOR.\nNow, Ajax, hold thine own!\n\nTROILUS.\nHector, thou sleep\u2019st; awake thee!\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nHis blows are well dispos\u2019d. There, Ajax!\n\n [_Trumpets cease_.]\n\nDIOMEDES.\nYou must no more.\n\nAENEAS.\nPrinces, enough, so please you.\n\nAJAX.\nI am not warm yet; let us fight again.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nAs Hector pleases.\n\nHECTOR.\nWhy, then will I no more.\nThou art, great lord, my father\u2019s sister\u2019s son,\nA cousin-german to great Priam\u2019s seed;\nThe obligation of our blood forbids\nA gory emulation \u2019twixt us twain:\nWere thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so\nThat thou could\u2019st say \u2018This hand is Grecian all,\nAnd this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg\nAll Greek, and this all Troy; my mother\u2019s blood\nRuns on the dexter cheek, and this sinister\nBounds in my father\u2019s; by Jove multipotent,\nThou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member\nWherein my sword had not impressure made\nOf our rank feud; but the just gods gainsay\nThat any drop thou borrow\u2019dst from thy mother,\nMy sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword\nBe drained! Let me embrace thee, Ajax.\nBy him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;\nHector would have them fall upon him thus.\nCousin, all honour to thee!\n\nAJAX.\nI thank thee, Hector.\nThou art too gentle and too free a man.\nI came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence\nA great addition earned in thy death.\n\nHECTOR.\nNot Neoptolemus so mirable,\nOn whose bright crest Fame with her loud\u2019st Oyes\nCries \u2018This is he!\u2019 could promise to himself\nA thought of added honour torn from Hector.\n\nAENEAS.\nThere is expectance here from both the sides\nWhat further you will do.\n\nHECTOR.\nWe\u2019ll answer it:\nThe issue is embracement. Ajax, farewell.\n\nAJAX.\nIf I might in entreaties find success,\nAs seld\u2019 I have the chance, I would desire\nMy famous cousin to our Grecian tents.\n\nDIOMEDES.\n\u2019Tis Agamemnon\u2019s wish; and great Achilles\nDoth long to see unarm\u2019d the valiant Hector.\n\nHECTOR.\nAeneas, call my brother Troilus to me,\nAnd signify this loving interview\nTo the expecters of our Trojan part;\nDesire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;\nI will go eat with thee, and see your knights.\n\nAgamemnon and the rest of the Greeks come forward.\n\nAJAX.\nGreat Agamemnon comes to meet us here.\n\nHECTOR.\nThe worthiest of them tell me name by name;\nBut for Achilles, my own searching eyes\nShall find him by his large and portly size.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWorthy all arms! as welcome as to one\nThat would be rid of such an enemy.\nBut that\u2019s no welcome. Understand more clear,\nWhat\u2019s past and what\u2019s to come is strew\u2019d with husks\nAnd formless ruin of oblivion;\nBut in this extant moment, faith and troth,\nStrain\u2019d purely from all hollow bias-drawing,\nBids thee with most divine integrity,\nFrom heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.\n\nHECTOR.\nI thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\n[_To Troilus._] My well-fam\u2019d lord of Troy, no less to you.\n\nMENELAUS.\nLet me confirm my princely brother\u2019s greeting.\nYou brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.\n\nHECTOR.\nWho must we answer?\n\nAENEAS.\nThe noble Menelaus.\n\nHECTOR.\nO you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet, thanks!\nMock not that I affect the untraded oath;\nYour quondam wife swears still by Venus\u2019 glove.\nShe\u2019s well, but bade me not commend her to you.\n\nMENELAUS.\nName her not now, sir; she\u2019s a deadly theme.\n\nHECTOR.\nO, pardon; I offend.\n\nNESTOR.\nI have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft,\nLabouring for destiny, make cruel way\nThrough ranks of Greekish youth; and I have seen thee,\nAs hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,\nDespising many forfeits and subduements,\nWhen thou hast hung thy advanced sword i\u2019 th\u2019air,\nNot letting it decline on the declined;\nThat I have said to some my standers-by\n\u2018Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!\u2019\nAnd I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,\nWhen that a ring of Greeks have shrap\u2019d thee in,\nLike an Olympian wrestling. This have I seen;\nBut this thy countenance, still lock\u2019d in steel,\nI never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,\nAnd once fought with him. He was a soldier good,\nBut, by great Mars, the captain of us all,\nNever like thee. O, let an old man embrace thee;\nAnd, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.\n\nAENEAS.\n\u2019Tis the old Nestor.\n\nHECTOR.\nLet me embrace thee, good old chronicle,\nThat hast so long walk\u2019d hand in hand with time.\nMost reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.\n\nNESTOR.\nI would my arms could match thee in contention\nAs they contend with thee in courtesy.\n\nHECTOR.\nI would they could.\n\nNESTOR.\nHa!\nBy this white beard, I\u2019d fight with thee tomorrow.\nWell, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.\n\nULYSSES.\nI wonder now how yonder city stands,\nWhen we have here her base and pillar by us.\n\nHECTOR.\nI know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.\nAh, sir, there\u2019s many a Greek and Trojan dead,\nSince first I saw yourself and Diomed\nIn Ilion on your Greekish embassy.\n\nULYSSES.\nSir, I foretold you then what would ensue.\nMy prophecy is but half his journey yet;\nFor yonder walls, that pertly front your town,\nYon towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,\nMust kiss their own feet.\n\nHECTOR.\nI must not believe you.\nThere they stand yet; and modestly I think\nThe fall of every Phrygian stone will cost\nA drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;\nAnd that old common arbitrator, Time,\nWill one day end it.\n\nULYSSES.\nSo to him we leave it.\nMost gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome.\nAfter the General, I beseech you next\nTo feast with me and see me at my tent.\n\nACHILLES.\nI shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!\nNow, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;\nI have with exact view perus\u2019d thee, Hector,\nAnd quoted joint by joint.\n\nHECTOR.\nIs this Achilles?\n\nACHILLES.\nI am Achilles.\n\nHECTOR.\nStand fair, I pray thee; let me look on thee.\n\nACHILLES.\nBehold thy fill.\n\nHECTOR.\nNay, I have done already.\n\nACHILLES.\nThou art too brief. I will the second time,\nAs I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.\n\nHECTOR.\nO, like a book of sport thou\u2019lt read me o\u2019er;\nBut there\u2019s more in me than thou understand\u2019st.\nWhy dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?\n\nACHILLES.\nTell me, you heavens, in which part of his body\nShall I destroy him? Whether there, or there, or there?\nThat I may give the local wound a name,\nAnd make distinct the very breach whereout\nHector\u2019s great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens.\n\nHECTOR.\nIt would discredit the blest gods, proud man,\nTo answer such a question. Stand again.\nThink\u2019st thou to catch my life so pleasantly\nAs to prenominate in nice conjecture\nWhere thou wilt hit me dead?\n\nACHILLES.\nI tell thee yea.\n\nHECTOR.\nWert thou an oracle to tell me so,\nI\u2019d not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;\nFor I\u2019ll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;\nBut, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,\nI\u2019ll kill thee everywhere, yea, o\u2019er and o\u2019er.\nYou wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag.\nHis insolence draws folly from my lips;\nBut I\u2019ll endeavour deeds to match these words,\nOr may I never\u2014\n\nAJAX.\nDo not chafe thee, cousin;\nAnd you, Achilles, let these threats alone\nTill accident or purpose bring you to\u2019t.\nYou may have every day enough of Hector,\nIf you have stomach. The general state, I fear,\nCan scarce entreat you to be odd with him.\n\nHECTOR.\nI pray you let us see you in the field;\nWe have had pelting wars since you refus\u2019d\nThe Grecians\u2019 cause.\n\nACHILLES.\nDost thou entreat me, Hector?\nTomorrow do I meet thee, fell as death;\nTonight all friends.\n\nHECTOR.\nThy hand upon that match.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nFirst, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;\nThere in the full convive we; afterwards,\nAs Hector\u2019s leisure and your bounties shall\nConcur together, severally entreat him.\nBeat loud the tambourines, let the trumpets blow,\nThat this great soldier may his welcome know.\n\n [_Exeunt all but Troilus and Ulysses_.]\n\nTROILUS.\nMy Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,\nIn what place of the field doth Calchas keep?\n\nULYSSES.\nAt Menelaus\u2019 tent, most princely Troilus.\nThere Diomed doth feast with him tonight,\nWho neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,\nBut gives all gaze and bent of amorous view\nOn the fair Cressid.\n\nTROILUS.\nShall I, sweet lord, be bound to you so much,\nAfter we part from Agamemnon\u2019s tent,\nTo bring me thither?\n\nULYSSES.\nYou shall command me, sir.\nAs gentle tell me of what honour was\nThis Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there\nThat wails her absence?\n\nTROILUS.\nO, sir, to such as boasting show their scars\nA mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?\nShe was belov\u2019d, she lov\u2019d; she is, and doth;\nBut still sweet love is food for fortune\u2019s tooth.\n\n [_Exeunt_.]\n\n\n\nACT V.\n\nSCENE I. The Grecian camp.

What\u2019s that?\n\nTHERSITES.\nWhy, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases of the south, the\nguts-griping ruptures, catarrhs, loads o\u2019 gravel in the back,\nlethargies, cold palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing lungs,\nbladders full of imposthume, sciaticas, lime-kilns i\u2019 th\u2019 palm,\nincurable bone-ache, and the rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take\nand take again such preposterous discoveries!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWhy, thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest thou to curse thus?\n\nTHERSITES.\nDo I curse thee?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWhy, no, you ruinous butt; you whoreson indistinguishable cur, no.\n\nTHERSITES.\nNo! Why art thou, then, exasperate, thou idle immaterial skein of\nsleave silk, thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a\nprodigal\u2019s purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is  pestered with such\nwater-flies, diminutives of nature!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nOut, gall!\n\nTHERSITES.\nFinch egg!\n\nACHILLES.\nMy sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite\nFrom my great purpose in tomorrow\u2019s battle.\nHere is a letter from Queen Hecuba,\nA token from her daughter, my fair love,\nBoth taxing me and gaging me to keep\nAn oath that I have sworn. I will not break it.\nFall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;\nMy major vow lies here, this I\u2019ll obey.\nCome, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent;\nThis night in banqueting must all be spent.\nAway, Patroclus!\n\n [_Exit with_ Patroclus.]\n\nTHERSITES.\nWith too much blood and too little brain these two may run mad; but, if\nwith too much brain and too little blood they do, I\u2019ll be a curer of\nmadmen. Here\u2019s Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough, and one that loves\nquails, but he has not so much brain as ear-wax; and the goodly\ntransformation of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull, the primitive\nstatue and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a thrifty shoeing-horn in a\nchain at his brother\u2019s leg, to what form but that he is, should wit\nlarded with malice, and malice forced with wit, turn him to? To an ass,\nwere nothing: he is both ass and ox. To an ox, were nothing: he is both\nox and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchook, a toad, a lizard,\nan owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would not care; but to\nbe Menelaus, I would conspire against destiny. Ask me not what I would\nbe, if I were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse of a lazar,\nso I were not Menelaus.

I\nwill rather leave to see Hector than not to dog him. They say he keeps\na Trojan drab, and uses the traitor Calchas\u2019 tent. I\u2019ll after. Nothing\nbut lechery!

No; this is Diomed\u2019s Cressida.\nIf beauty have a soul, this is not she;\nIf souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,\nIf sanctimony be the god\u2019s delight,\nIf there be rule in unity itself,\nThis was not she. O madness of discourse,\nThat cause sets up with and against itself!\nBi-fold authority! where reason can revolt\nWithout perdition, and loss assume all reason\nWithout revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.\nWithin my soul there doth conduce a fight\nOf this strange nature, that a thing inseparate\nDivides more wider than the sky and earth;\nAnd yet the spacious breadth of this division\nAdmits no orifice for a point as subtle\nAs Ariachne\u2019s broken woof to enter.\nInstance, O instance! strong as Pluto\u2019s gates:\nCressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven.\nInstance, O instance! strong as heaven itself:\nThe bonds of heaven are slipp\u2019d, dissolv\u2019d, and loos\u2019d;\nAnd with another knot, five-finger-tied,\nThe fractions of her faith, orts of her love,\nThe fragments, scraps, the bits, and greasy relics\nOf her o\u2019er-eaten faith, are given to Diomed.\n\nULYSSES.\nMay worthy Troilus be half attach\u2019d\nWith that which here his passion doth express?\n\nTROILUS.\nAy, Greek; and that shall be divulged well\nIn characters as red as Mars his heart\nInflam\u2019d with Venus. Never did young man fancy\nWith so eternal and so fix\u2019d a soul.\nHark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,\nSo much by weight hate I her Diomed.\nThat sleeve is mine that he\u2019ll bear on his helm;\nWere it a casque compos\u2019d by Vulcan\u2019s skill\nMy sword should bite it. Not the dreadful spout\nWhich shipmen do the hurricano call,\nConstring\u2019d in mass by the almighty sun,\nShall dizzy with more clamour Neptune\u2019s ear\nIn his descent than shall my prompted sword\nFalling on Diomed.\n\nTHERSITES.\nHe\u2019ll tickle it for his concupy.\n\nTROILUS.\nO Cressid!

Do not count it holy\nTo hurt by being just. It is as lawful,\nFor we would give much, to use violent thefts\nAnd rob in the behalf of charity.\n\nCASSANDRA.\nIt is the purpose that makes strong the vow;\nBut vows to every purpose must not hold.\nUnarm, sweet Hector.\n\nHECTOR.\nHold you still, I say.\nMine honour keeps the weather of my fate.\nLife every man holds dear; but the dear man\nHolds honour far more precious dear than life.\n\n Enter Troilus.\n\nHow now, young man!

That\ndissembling abominable varlet, Diomed, has got that same scurvy doting\nfoolish young knave\u2019s sleeve of Troy there in his helm. I would fain\nsee them meet, that that same young Trojan ass that loves the whore\nthere might send that Greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve\nback to the dissembling luxurious drab of a sleeve-less errand. O\u2019 the\nother side, the policy of those crafty swearing rascals that stale old\nmouse-eaten dry cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is not\nprov\u2019d worth a blackberry. They set me up, in policy, that mongrel cur,\nAjax, against that dog of as bad a kind, Achilles; and now is the cur,\nAjax prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm today; whereupon\nthe Grecians begin to proclaim barbarism, and policy grows into an ill\nopinion.\n\n Enter Diomedes, Troilus following.\n\nSoft! here comes sleeve, and t\u2019other.\n\nTROILUS.\nFly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx, I would swim after.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nThou dost miscall retire.\nI do not fly; but advantageous care\nWithdrew me from the odds of multitude.\nHave at thee!\n\nTHERSITES.\nHold thy whore, Grecian; now for thy whore,\nTrojan! now the sleeve, now the sleeve!\n\n [_Exeunt Troilus and Diomedes fighting_.]\n\n Enter Hector.\n\nHECTOR.\nWhat art thou, Greek?

Live.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nTHERSITES.\nGod-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a plague break thy neck for\nfrighting me! What\u2019s become of the wenching rogues?

Great Achilles\nIs arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance.\nPatroclus\u2019 wounds have rous\u2019d his drowsy blood,\nTogether with his mangled Myrmidons,\nThat noseless, handless, hack\u2019d and chipp\u2019d, come to him,\nCrying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend\nAnd foams at mouth, and he is arm\u2019d and at it,\nRoaring for Troilus; who hath done today\nMad and fantastic execution,\nEngaging and redeeming of himself\nWith such a careless force and forceless care\nAs if that lust, in very spite of cunning,\nBade him win all.\n\n Enter Ajax.\n\nAJAX.\nTroilus! thou coward Troilus!\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\nDIOMEDES.\nAy, there, there.\n\nNESTOR.\nSo, so, we draw together.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\n Enter Achilles.\n\nACHILLES.\nWhere is this Hector?\nCome, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face;\nKnow what it is to meet Achilles angry.\nHector! where\u2019s Hector?

You vile abominable tents,\nThus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,\nLet Titan rise as early as he dare,\nI\u2019ll through and through you. And, thou great-siz\u2019d coward,\nNo space of earth shall sunder our two hates;\nI\u2019ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,\nThat mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy\u2019s thoughts.\nStrike a free march to Troy. With comfort go;\nHope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.\n\n Enter Pandarus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nBut hear you, hear you!\n\nTROILUS.\nHence, broker-lackey. Ignominy and shame\nPursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!\n\n [_Exeunt all but_ Pandarus.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nA goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world! world! Thus is the poor\nagent despis\u2019d! O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set a-work,\nand how ill requited! Why should our endeavour be so lov\u2019d, and the\nperformance so loathed? What verse for it? What instance for it? Let me\nsee\u2014\n\n  Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing\n  Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;\n  And being once subdu\u2019d in armed trail,\n  Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.\n\nGood traders in the flesh, set this in your painted cloths.\nAs many as be here of Pandar\u2019s hall,\nYour eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar\u2019s fall;\nOr, if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,\nThough not for me, yet for your aching bones.\nBrethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,\nSome two months hence my will shall here be made.\nIt should be now, but that my fear is this,\nSome galled goose of Winchester would hiss.\nTill then I\u2019ll sweat and seek about for eases,\nAnd at that time bequeath you my diseases.\n\n [_Exit_.]\n\n\n"
