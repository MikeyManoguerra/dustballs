Britain. The garden of Cymbeline\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter two Gentlemen.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nYou do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods\nNo more obey the heavens than our courtiers\nStill seem as does the King\u2019s.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nBut what\u2019s the matter?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHis daughter, and the heir of\u2019s kingdom, whom\nHe purpos\u2019d to his wife\u2019s sole son\u2014a widow\nThat late he married\u2014hath referr\u2019d herself\nUnto a poor but worthy gentleman. She\u2019s wedded;\nHer husband banish\u2019d; she imprison\u2019d. All\nIs outward sorrow, though I think the King\nBe touch\u2019d at very heart.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nNone but the King?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHe that hath lost her too. So is the Queen,\nThat most desir\u2019d the match. But not a courtier,\nAlthough they wear their faces to the bent\nOf the King\u2019s looks, hath a heart that is not\nGlad at the thing they scowl at.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nAnd why so?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHe that hath miss\u2019d the Princess is a thing\nToo bad for bad report; and he that hath her\u2014\nI mean that married her, alack, good man!\nAnd therefore banish\u2019d\u2014is a creature such\nAs, to seek through the regions of the earth\nFor one his like, there would be something failing\nIn him that should compare. I do not think\nSo fair an outward and such stuff within\nEndows a man but he.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nYou speak him far.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nI do extend him, sir, within himself;\nCrush him together rather than unfold\nHis measure duly.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nWhat\u2019s his name and birth?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nI cannot delve him to the root; his father\nWas call\u2019d Sicilius, who did join his honour\nAgainst the Romans with Cassibelan,\nBut had his titles by Tenantius, whom\nHe serv\u2019d with glory and admir\u2019d success,\nSo gain\u2019d the sur-addition Leonatus;\nAnd had, besides this gentleman in question,\nTwo other sons, who, in the wars o\u2019 th\u2019 time,\nDied with their swords in hand; for which their father,\nThen old and fond of issue, took such sorrow\nThat he quit being; and his gentle lady,\nBig of this gentleman, our theme, deceas\u2019d\nAs he was born. The King he takes the babe\nTo his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,\nBreeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,\nPuts to him all the learnings that his time\nCould make him the receiver of; which he took,\nAs we do air, fast as \u2019twas minist\u2019red,\nAnd in\u2019s spring became a harvest, liv\u2019d in court\u2014\nWhich rare it is to do\u2014most prais\u2019d, most lov\u2019d,\nA sample to the youngest; to th\u2019 more mature\nA glass that feated them; and to the graver\nA child that guided dotards. To his mistress,\nFor whom he now is banish\u2019d, her own price\nProclaims how she esteem\u2019d him and his virtue;\nBy her election may be truly read\nWhat kind of man he is.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nI honour him\nEven out of your report. But pray you tell me,\nIs she sole child to th\u2019 King?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHis only child.\nHe had two sons\u2014if this be worth your hearing,\nMark it\u2014the eldest of them at three years old,\nI\u2019 th\u2019 swathing clothes the other, from their nursery\nWere stol\u2019n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge\nWhich way they went.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nHow long is this ago?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nSome twenty years.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nThat a king\u2019s children should be so convey\u2019d,\nSo slackly guarded, and the search so slow\nThat could not trace them!\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHowsoe\u2019er \u2019tis strange,\nOr that the negligence may well be laugh\u2019d at,\nYet is it true, sir.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nI do well believe you.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nWe must forbear; here comes the gentleman,\nThe Queen, and Princess.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. The same.\n\n Enter Queen, Posthumus and Imogen.\n\nQUEEN.\nNo, be assur\u2019d you shall not find me, daughter,\nAfter the slander of most stepmothers,\nEvil-ey\u2019d unto you. You\u2019re my prisoner, but\nYour gaoler shall deliver you the keys\nThat lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,\nSo soon as I can win th\u2019 offended King,\nI will be known your advocate. Marry, yet\nThe fire of rage is in him, and \u2019twere good\nYou lean\u2019d unto his sentence with what patience\nYour wisdom may inform you.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nPlease your Highness,\nI will from hence today.\n\nQUEEN.\nYou know the peril.\nI\u2019ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying\nThe pangs of barr\u2019d affections, though the King\nHath charg\u2019d you should not speak together.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nIMOGEN.\nO dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant\nCan tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,\nI something fear my father\u2019s wrath, but nothing\n(Always reserv\u2019d my holy duty) what\nHis rage can do on me. You must be gone;\nAnd I shall here abide the hourly shot\nOf angry eyes, not comforted to live\nBut that there is this jewel in the world\nThat I may see again.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nMy queen! my mistress!\nO lady, weep no more, lest I give cause\nTo be suspected of more tenderness\nThan doth become a man. I will remain\nThe loyal\u2019st husband that did e\u2019er plight troth;\nMy residence in Rome at one Philario\u2019s,\nWho to my father was a friend, to me\nKnown but by letter; thither write, my queen,\nAnd with mine eyes I\u2019ll drink the words you send,\nThough ink be made of gall.\n\n Enter Queen.\n\nQUEEN.\nBe brief, I pray you.\nIf the King come, I shall incur I know not\nHow much of his displeasure. [_Aside._] Yet I\u2019ll move him\nTo walk this way. I never do him wrong\nBut he does buy my injuries, to be friends;\nPays dear for my offences.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nShould we be taking leave\nAs long a term as yet we have to live,\nThe loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!\n\nIMOGEN.\nNay, stay a little.\nWere you but riding forth to air yourself,\nSuch parting were too petty. Look here, love:\nThis diamond was my mother\u2019s; take it, heart;\nBut keep it till you woo another wife,\nWhen Imogen is dead.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nHow, how? Another?\nYou gentle gods, give me but this I have,\nAnd sear up my embracements from a next\nWith bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here\n\n [_Puts on the ring._]\n\nWhile sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,\nAs I my poor self did exchange for you,\nTo your so infinite loss, so in our trifles\nI still win of you. For my sake wear this;\nIt is a manacle of love; I\u2019ll place it\nUpon this fairest prisoner.\n\n [_Puts a bracelet on her arm._]\n\nIMOGEN.\nO the gods!\nWhen shall we see again?\n\n Enter Cymbeline and Lords.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nAlack, the King!\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThou basest thing, avoid; hence from my sight\nIf after this command thou fraught the court\nWith thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!\nThou\u2019rt poison to my blood.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThe gods protect you,\nAnd bless the good remainders of the court!\nI am gone.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nIMOGEN.\nThere cannot be a pinch in death\nMore sharp than this is.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nO disloyal thing,\nThat shouldst repair my youth, thou heap\u2019st\nA year\u2019s age on me!\n\nIMOGEN.\nI beseech you, sir,\nHarm not yourself with your vexation.\nI am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare\nSubdues all pangs, all fears.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nPast grace? obedience?\n\nIMOGEN.\nPast hope, and in despair; that way past grace.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThat mightst have had the sole son of my queen!\n\nIMOGEN.\nO blessed that I might not! I chose an eagle,\nAnd did avoid a puttock.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThou took\u2019st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne\nA seat for baseness.\n\nIMOGEN.\nNo; I rather added\nA lustre to it.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nO thou vile one!\n\nIMOGEN.\nSir,\nIt is your fault that I have lov\u2019d Posthumus.\nYou bred him as my playfellow, and he is\nA man worth any woman; overbuys me\nAlmost the sum he pays.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWhat, art thou mad?\n\nIMOGEN.\nAlmost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were\nA neat-herd\u2019s daughter, and my Leonatus\nOur neighbour shepherd\u2019s son!\n\n Enter Queen.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThou foolish thing!\n[_To the Queen._] They were again together. You have done\nNot after our command. Away with her,\nAnd pen her up.\n\nQUEEN.\nBeseech your patience. Peace,\nDear lady daughter, peace!\u2014Sweet sovereign,\nLeave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort\nOut of your best advice.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nNay, let her languish\nA drop of blood a day and, being aged,\nDie of this folly.\n\n [_Exit with Lords._]\n\n Enter Pisanio.\n\nQUEEN.\nFie! you must give way.\nHere is your servant. How now, sir! What news?\n\nPISANIO.\nMy lord your son drew on my master.\n\nQUEEN.\nHa!\nNo harm, I trust, is done?\n\nPISANIO.\nThere might have been,\nBut that my master rather play\u2019d than fought,\nAnd had no help of anger; they were parted\nBy gentlemen at hand.\n\nQUEEN.\nI am very glad on\u2019t.\n\nIMOGEN.\nYour son\u2019s my father\u2019s friend; he takes his part\nTo draw upon an exile! O brave sir!\nI would they were in Afric both together;\nMyself by with a needle, that I might prick\nThe goer-back. Why came you from your master?\n\nPISANIO.\nOn his command. He would not suffer me\nTo bring him to the haven; left these notes\nOf what commands I should be subject to,\nWhen\u2019t pleas\u2019d you to employ me.\n\nQUEEN.\nThis hath been\nYour faithful servant. I dare lay mine honour\nHe will remain so.\n\nPISANIO.\nI humbly thank your Highness.\n\nQUEEN.\nPray walk awhile.\n\nIMOGEN.\nAbout some half-hour hence,\nPray you speak with me.\nYou shall at least go see my lord aboard.\nFor this time leave me.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Britain. A public place.\n\n Enter Cloten and two Lords.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nSir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath\nmade you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in;\nthere\u2019s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.\n\nCLOTEN.\nIf my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] No, faith; not so much as his patience.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHurt him! His body\u2019s a passable carcass if he be not hurt. It is a\nthroughfare for steel if it be not hurt.\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] His steel was in debt; it went o\u2019 th\u2019 backside the town.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThe villain would not stand me.\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nStand you? You have land enough of your own; but he added to your\nhaving, gave you some ground.\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] As many inches as you have oceans.\nPuppies!\n\nCLOTEN.\nI would they had not come between us.\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] So would I, till you had measur\u2019d how long a fool you were\nupon the ground.\n\nCLOTEN.\nAnd that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damn\u2019d.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nSir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go not together;\nshe\u2019s a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt\nher.\n\nCLOTEN.\nCome, I\u2019ll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt done!\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of an ass, which\nis no great hurt.\n\nCLOTEN.\nYou\u2019ll go with us?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI\u2019ll attend your lordship.\n\nCLOTEN.\nNay, come, let\u2019s go together.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWell, my lord.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. Britain. Cymbeline\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Imogen and Pisanio.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI would thou grew\u2019st unto the shores o\u2019 th\u2019 haven,\nAnd questioned\u2019st every sail; if he should write,\nAnd I not have it, \u2019twere a paper lost,\nAs offer\u2019d mercy is. What was the last\nThat he spake to thee?\n\nPISANIO.\nIt was: his queen, his queen!\n\nIMOGEN.\nThen wav\u2019d his handkerchief?\n\nPISANIO.\nAnd kiss\u2019d it, madam.\n\nIMOGEN.\nSenseless linen, happier therein than I!\nAnd that was all?\n\nPISANIO.\nNo, madam; for so long\nAs he could make me with his eye, or ear\nDistinguish him from others, he did keep\nThe deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,\nStill waving, as the fits and stirs of\u2019s mind\nCould best express how slow his soul sail\u2019d on,\nHow swift his ship.\n\nIMOGEN.\nThou shouldst have made him\nAs little as a crow, or less, ere left\nTo after-eye him.\n\nPISANIO.\nMadam, so I did.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI would have broke mine eyestrings, crack\u2019d them but\nTo look upon him, till the diminution\nOf space had pointed him sharp as my needle;\nNay, followed him till he had melted from\nThe smallness of a gnat to air, and then\nHave turn\u2019d mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,\nWhen shall we hear from him?\n\nPISANIO.\nBe assur\u2019d, madam,\nWith his next vantage.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI did not take my leave of him, but had\nMost pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him\nHow I would think on him at certain hours\nSuch thoughts and such; or I could make him swear\nThe shes of Italy should not betray\nMine interest and his honour; or have charg\u2019d him,\nAt the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,\nT\u2019 encounter me with orisons, for then\nI am in heaven for him; or ere I could\nGive him that parting kiss which I had set\nBetwixt two charming words, comes in my father,\nAnd like the tyrannous breathing of the north\nShakes all our buds from growing.\n\n Enter a Lady.\n\nLADY.\nThe Queen, madam,\nDesires your Highness\u2019 company.\n\nIMOGEN.\nThose things I bid you do, get them dispatch\u2019d.\nI will attend the Queen.\n\nPISANIO.\nMadam, I shall.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Rome. Philario\u2019s house.\n\n Enter Philario, Iachimo, a Frenchman, a Dutchman and a Spaniard.\n\nIACHIMO.\nBelieve it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a crescent\nnote, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the\nname of. But I could then have look\u2019d on him without the help of\nadmiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by\nhis side, and I to peruse him by items.\n\nPHILARIO.\nYou speak of him when he was less furnish\u2019d than now he is with that\nwhich makes him both without and within.\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nI have seen him in France; we had very many there could behold the sun\nwith as firm eyes as he.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThis matter of marrying his king\u2019s daughter, wherein he must be weighed\nrather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal\nfrom the matter.\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nAnd then his banishment.\n\nIACHIMO.\nAy, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce\nunder her colours are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortify\nher judgement, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a\nbeggar, without less quality. But how comes it he is to sojourn with\nyou? How creeps acquaintance?\n\nPHILARIO.\nHis father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have been often\nbound for no less than my life.\n\n Enter Posthumus.\n\nHere comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as suits\nwith gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality. I beseech\nyou all be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you as a\nnoble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear\nhereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nSir, we have known together in Orleans.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nSince when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be\never to pay and yet pay still.\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nSir, you o\u2019errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did atone my\ncountryman and you; it had been pity you should have been put together\nwith so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so\nslight and trivial a nature.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nBy your pardon, sir. I was then a young traveller; rather shunn\u2019d to go\neven with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others\u2019\nexperiences; but upon my mended judgement (if I offend not to say it is\nmended) my quarrel was not altogether slight.\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nFaith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and by such two\nthat would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have\nfall\u2019n both.\n\nIACHIMO.\nCan we, with manners, ask what was the difference?\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nSafely, I think. \u2019Twas a contention in public, which may, without\ncontradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument that\nfell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country\nmistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching (and upon warrant of\nbloody affirmation) his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste,\nconstant, qualified, and less attemptable, than any the rarest of our\nladies in France.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThat lady is not now living, or this gentleman\u2019s opinion, by this, worn\nout.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nShe holds her virtue still, and I my mind.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYou must not so far prefer her \u2019fore ours of Italy.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nBeing so far provok\u2019d as I was in France, I would abate her nothing,\nthough I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.\n\nIACHIMO.\nAs fair and as good\u2014a kind of hand-in-hand comparison\u2014had been\nsomething too fair and too good for any lady in Britain. If she went\nbefore others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many I\nhave beheld, I could not but believe she excelled many; but I have not\nseen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI prais\u2019d her as I rated her. So do I my stone.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWhat do you esteem it at?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nMore than the world enjoys.\n\nIACHIMO.\nEither your unparagon\u2019d mistress is dead, or she\u2019s outpriz\u2019d by a\ntrifle.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYou are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, if there were wealth\nenough for the purchase or merit for the gift; the other is not a thing\nfor sale, and only the gift of the gods.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWhich the gods have given you?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nWhich by their graces I will keep.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYou may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl light upon\nneighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stol\u2019n too. So your brace of\nunprizable estimations, the one is but frail and the other casual; a\ncunning thief, or a that-way-accomplish\u2019d courtier, would hazard the\nwinning both of first and last.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYour Italy contains none so accomplish\u2019d a courtier to convince the\nhonour of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of that you term her\nfrail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding, I\nfear not my ring.\n\nPHILARIO.\nLet us leave here, gentlemen.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nSir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes no\nstranger of me; we are familiar at first.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWith five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair\nmistress; make her go back even to the yielding, had I admittance and\nopportunity to friend.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nNo, no.\n\nIACHIMO.\nI dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring, which, in\nmy opinion, o\u2019ervalues it something. But I make my wager rather against\nyour confidence than her reputation; and, to bar your offence herein\ntoo, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYou are a great deal abus\u2019d in too bold a persuasion, and I doubt not\nyou sustain what y\u2019are worthy of by your attempt.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWhat\u2019s that?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nA repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve more; a\npunishment too.\n\nPHILARIO.\nGentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let it die as it\nwas born, and I pray you be better acquainted.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWould I had put my estate and my neighbour\u2019s on th\u2019 approbation of what\nI have spoke!\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nWhat lady would you choose to assail?\n\nIACHIMO.\nYours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten\nthousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the court where your\nlady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second\nconference, and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you\nimagine so reserv\u2019d.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as my\nfinger; \u2019tis part of it.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYou are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies\u2019 flesh at a\nmillion a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I see you\nhave some religion in you, that you fear.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThis is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I hope.\n\nIACHIMO.\nI am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what\u2019s spoken, I\nswear.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nWill you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return. Let there be\ncovenants drawn between\u2019s. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness\nof your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this match: here\u2019s my ring.\n\nPHILARIO.\nI will have it no lay.\n\nIACHIMO.\nBy the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I\nhave enjoy\u2019d the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand\nducats are yours; so is your diamond too. If I come off, and leave her\nin such honour as you have trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel,\nand my gold are yours: provided I have your commendation for my more\nfree entertainment.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus\nfar you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her, and give me\ndirectly to understand you have prevail\u2019d, I am no further your enemy;\nshe is not worth our debate; if she remain unseduc\u2019d, you not making it\nappear otherwise, for your ill opinion and th\u2019 assault you have made to\nher chastity you shall answer me with your sword.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYour hand, a covenant! We will have these things set down by lawful\ncounsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain should catch\ncold and starve. I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nAgreed.\n\n [_Exeunt Posthumus and Iachimo._]\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nWill this hold, think you?\n\nPHILARIO.\nSignior Iachimo will not from it. Pray let us follow \u2019em.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. Britain. Cymbeline\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Queen, Ladies and Cornelius.\n\nQUEEN.\nWhiles yet the dew\u2019s on ground, gather those flowers;\nMake haste; who has the note of them?\n\nLADY.\nI, madam.\n\nQUEEN.\nDispatch.\n\n [_Exeunt Ladies._]\n\nNow, Master Doctor, have you brought those drugs?\n\nCORNELIUS.\nPleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.\n\n [_Presenting a box._]\n\nBut I beseech your Grace, without offence,\n(My conscience bids me ask) wherefore you have\nCommanded of me these most poisonous compounds\nWhich are the movers of a languishing death,\nBut, though slow, deadly?\n\nQUEEN.\nI wonder, Doctor,\nThou ask\u2019st me such a question. Have I not been\nThy pupil long? Hast thou not learn\u2019d me how\nTo make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so\nThat our great king himself doth woo me oft\nFor my confections? Having thus far proceeded\n(Unless thou think\u2019st me devilish) is\u2019t not meet\nThat I did amplify my judgement in\nOther conclusions? I will try the forces\nOf these thy compounds on such creatures as\nWe count not worth the hanging (but none human)\nTo try the vigour of them, and apply\nAllayments to their act, and by them gather\nTheir several virtues and effects.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nYour Highness\nShall from this practice but make hard your heart;\nBesides, the seeing these effects will be\nBoth noisome and infectious.\n\nQUEEN.\nO, content thee.\n\n Enter Pisanio.\n\n[_Aside._] Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him\nWill I first work. He\u2019s for his master,\nAn enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!\nDoctor, your service for this time is ended;\nTake your own way.\n\nCORNELIUS.\n[_Aside._] I do suspect you, madam;\nBut you shall do no harm.\n\nQUEEN.\n[_To Pisanio._] Hark thee, a word.\n\nCORNELIUS.\n[_Aside._] I do not like her. She doth think she has\nStrange ling\u2019ring poisons. I do know her spirit,\nAnd will not trust one of her malice with\nA drug of such damn\u2019d nature. Those she has\nWill stupefy and dull the sense awhile,\nWhich first perchance she\u2019ll prove on cats and dogs,\nThen afterward up higher; but there is\nNo danger in what show of death it makes,\nMore than the locking up the spirits a time,\nTo be more fresh, reviving. She is fool\u2019d\nWith a most false effect; and I the truer\nSo to be false with her.\n\nQUEEN.\nNo further service, Doctor,\nUntil I send for thee.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nI humbly take my leave.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nQUEEN.\nWeeps she still, say\u2019st thou? Dost thou think in time\nShe will not quench, and let instructions enter\nWhere folly now possesses? Do thou work.\nWhen thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,\nI\u2019ll tell thee on the instant thou art then\nAs great as is thy master; greater, for\nHis fortunes all lie speechless, and his name\nIs at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor\nContinue where he is. To shift his being\nIs to exchange one misery with another,\nAnd every day that comes comes to decay\nA day\u2019s work in him. What shalt thou expect\nTo be depender on a thing that leans,\nWho cannot be new built, nor has no friends\nSo much as but to prop him?\n\n [_The Queen drops the box. Pisanio takes it up._]\n\nThou tak\u2019st up\nThou know\u2019st not what; but take it for thy labour.\nIt is a thing I made, which hath the King\nFive times redeem\u2019d from death. I do not know\nWhat is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it;\nIt is an earnest of a further good\nThat I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how\nThe case stands with her; do\u2019t as from thyself.\nThink what a chance thou changest on; but think\nThou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,\nWho shall take notice of thee. I\u2019ll move the King\nTo any shape of thy preferment, such\nAs thou\u2019lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,\nThat set thee on to this desert, am bound\nTo load thy merit richly. Call my women.\nThink on my words.\n\n [_Exit Pisanio._]\n\nA sly and constant knave,\nNot to be shak\u2019d; the agent for his master,\nAnd the remembrancer of her to hold\nThe hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that\nWhich, if he take, shall quite unpeople her\nOf liegers for her sweet; and which she after,\nExcept she bend her humour, shall be assur\u2019d\nTo taste of too.\n\n Enter Pisanio and Ladies.\n\nSo, so. Well done, well done.\nThe violets, cowslips, and the primroses,\nBear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;\nThink on my words.\n\n [_Exeunt Queen and Ladies._]\n\nPISANIO.\nAnd shall do.\nBut when to my good lord I prove untrue\nI\u2019ll choke myself: there\u2019s all I\u2019ll do for you.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE VII. Britain. The palace.\n\n Enter Imogen alone.\n\nIMOGEN.\nA father cruel and a step-dame false;\nA foolish suitor to a wedded lady\nThat hath her husband banish\u2019d. O, that husband!\nMy supreme crown of grief! and those repeated\nVexations of it! Had I been thief-stol\u2019n,\nAs my two brothers, happy! but most miserable\nIs the desire that\u2019s glorious. Blessed be those,\nHow mean soe\u2019er, that have their honest wills,\nWhich seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!\n\n Enter Pisanio and Iachimo.\n\nPISANIO.\nMadam, a noble gentleman of Rome\nComes from my lord with letters.\n\nIACHIMO.\nChange you, madam?\nThe worthy Leonatus is in safety,\nAnd greets your Highness dearly.\n\n [_Presents a letter._]\n\nIMOGEN.\nThanks, good sir.\nYou\u2019re kindly welcome.\n\nIACHIMO.\n[_Aside._] All of her that is out of door most rich!\nIf she be furnish\u2019d with a mind so rare,\nShe is alone th\u2019 Arabian bird, and I\nHave lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!\nArm me, audacity, from head to foot!\nOr, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;\nRather, directly fly.\n\nIMOGEN.\n[_Reads._] _He is one of the noblest note, to whose kindnesses I am\nmost infinitely tied. Reflect upon him accordingly, as you value your\ntrust.\n                    LEONATUS._\n\nSo far I read aloud;\nBut even the very middle of my heart\nIs warm\u2019d by th\u2019 rest and takes it thankfully.\nYou are as welcome, worthy sir, as I\nHave words to bid you; and shall find it so\nIn all that I can do.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThanks, fairest lady.\nWhat, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes\nTo see this vaulted arch and the rich crop\nOf sea and land, which can distinguish \u2019twixt\nThe fiery orbs above and the twinn\u2019d stones\nUpon the number\u2019d beach, and can we not\nPartition make with spectacles so precious\n\u2019Twixt fair and foul?\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat makes your admiration?\n\nIACHIMO.\nIt cannot be i\u2019 th\u2019 eye, for apes and monkeys,\n\u2019Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and\nContemn with mows the other; nor i\u2019 th\u2019 judgement,\nFor idiots in this case of favour would\nBe wisely definite; nor i\u2019 th\u2019 appetite;\nSluttery, to such neat excellence oppos\u2019d,\nShould make desire vomit emptiness,\nNot so allur\u2019d to feed.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat is the matter, trow?\n\nIACHIMO.\nThe cloyed will\u2014\nThat satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub\nBoth fill\u2019d and running\u2014ravening first the lamb,\nLongs after for the garbage.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat, dear sir,\nThus raps you? Are you well?\n\nIACHIMO.\nThanks, madam; well. Beseech you, sir,\nDesire my man\u2019s abode where I did leave him.\nHe\u2019s strange and peevish.\n\nPISANIO.\nI was going, sir,\nTo give him welcome.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nIMOGEN.\nContinues well my lord? His health beseech you?\n\nIACHIMO.\nWell, madam.\n\nIMOGEN.\nIs he dispos\u2019d to mirth? I hope he is.\n\nIACHIMO.\nExceeding pleasant; none a stranger there\nSo merry and so gamesome. He is call\u2019d\nThe Briton reveller.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhen he was here\nHe did incline to sadness, and oft-times\nNot knowing why.\n\nIACHIMO.\nI never saw him sad.\nThere is a Frenchman his companion, one\nAn eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves\nA Gallian girl at home. He furnaces\nThe thick sighs from him; whiles the jolly Briton\n(Your lord, I mean) laughs from\u2019s free lungs, cries \u201cO,\nCan my sides hold, to think that man, who knows\nBy history, report, or his own proof,\nWhat woman is, yea, what she cannot choose\nBut must be, will\u2019s free hours languish for\nAssured bondage?\u201d\n\nIMOGEN.\nWill my lord say so?\n\nIACHIMO.\nAy, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.\nIt is a recreation to be by\nAnd hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know\nSome men are much to blame.\n\nIMOGEN.\nNot he, I hope.\n\nIACHIMO.\nNot he; but yet heaven\u2019s bounty towards him might\nBe us\u2019d more thankfully. In himself, \u2019tis much;\nIn you, which I account his, beyond all talents.\nWhilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound\nTo pity too.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat do you pity, sir?\n\nIACHIMO.\nTwo creatures heartily.\n\nIMOGEN.\nAm I one, sir?\nYou look on me: what wreck discern you in me\nDeserves your pity?\n\nIACHIMO.\nLamentable! What,\nTo hide me from the radiant sun and solace\nI\u2019 th\u2019 dungeon by a snuff?\n\nIMOGEN.\nI pray you, sir,\nDeliver with more openness your answers\nTo my demands. Why do you pity me?\n\nIACHIMO.\nThat others do,\nI was about to say, enjoy your\u2014But\nIt is an office of the gods to venge it,\nNot mine to speak on\u2019t.\n\nIMOGEN.\nYou do seem to know\nSomething of me, or what concerns me; pray you,\nSince doubting things go ill often hurts more\nThan to be sure they do; for certainties\nEither are past remedies, or, timely knowing,\nThe remedy then born\u2014discover to me\nWhat both you spur and stop.\n\nIACHIMO.\nHad I this cheek\nTo bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,\nWhose every touch, would force the feeler\u2019s soul\nTo th\u2019 oath of loyalty; this object, which\nTakes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,\nFixing it only here; should I, damn\u2019d then,\nSlaver with lips as common as the stairs\nThat mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands\nMade hard with hourly falsehood (falsehood as\nWith labour): then by-peeping in an eye\nBase and illustrious as the smoky light\nThat\u2019s fed with stinking tallow: it were fit\nThat all the plagues of hell should at one time\nEncounter such revolt.\n\nIMOGEN.\nMy lord, I fear,\nHas forgot Britain.\n\nIACHIMO.\nAnd himself. Not I\nInclin\u2019d to this intelligence pronounce\nThe beggary of his change; but \u2019tis your graces\nThat from my mutest conscience to my tongue\nCharms this report out.\n\nIMOGEN.\nLet me hear no more.\n\nIACHIMO.\nO dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart\nWith pity that doth make me sick! A lady\nSo fair, and fasten\u2019d to an empery,\nWould make the great\u2019st king double, to be partner\u2019d\nWith tomboys hir\u2019d with that self exhibition\nWhich your own coffers yield! with diseas\u2019d ventures\nThat play with all infirmities for gold\nWhich rottenness can lend nature! Such boil\u2019d stuff\nAs well might poison poison! Be reveng\u2019d;\nOr she that bore you was no queen, and you\nRecoil from your great stock.\n\nIMOGEN.\nReveng\u2019d?\nHow should I be reveng\u2019d? If this be true,\n(As I have such a heart that both mine ears\nMust not in haste abuse) if it be true,\nHow should I be reveng\u2019d?\n\nIACHIMO.\nShould he make me\nLive like Diana\u2019s priest betwixt cold sheets,\nWhiles he is vaulting variable ramps,\nIn your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.\nI dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,\nMore noble than that runagate to your bed,\nAnd will continue fast to your affection,\nStill close as sure.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat ho, Pisanio!\n\nIACHIMO.\nLet me my service tender on your lips.\n\nIMOGEN.\nAway! I do condemn mine ears that have\nSo long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,\nThou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not\nFor such an end thou seek\u2019st, as base as strange.\nThou wrong\u2019st a gentleman who is as far\nFrom thy report as thou from honour; and\nSolicits here a lady that disdains\nThee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!\nThe King my father shall be made acquainted\nOf thy assault. If he shall think it fit\nA saucy stranger in his court to mart\nAs in a Romish stew, and to expound\nHis beastly mind to us, he hath a court\nHe little cares for, and a daughter who\nHe not respects at all. What ho, Pisanio!\n\nIACHIMO.\nO happy Leonatus! I may say\nThe credit that thy lady hath of thee\nDeserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness\nHer assur\u2019d credit. Blessed live you long,\nA lady to the worthiest sir that ever\nCountry call\u2019d his! and you his mistress, only\nFor the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.\nI have spoke this to know if your affiance\nWere deeply rooted, and shall make your lord\nThat which he is new o\u2019er; and he is one\nThe truest manner\u2019d, such a holy witch\nThat he enchants societies into him,\nHalf all men\u2019s hearts are his.\n\nIMOGEN.\nYou make amends.\n\nIACHIMO.\nHe sits \u2019mongst men like a descended god:\nHe hath a kind of honour sets him off\nMore than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,\nMost mighty Princess, that I have adventur\u2019d\nTo try your taking of a false report, which hath\nHonour\u2019d with confirmation your great judgement\nIn the election of a sir so rare,\nWhich you know cannot err. The love I bear him\nMade me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,\nUnlike all others, chaffless. Pray your pardon.\n\nIMOGEN.\nAll\u2019s well, sir; take my pow\u2019r i\u2019 th\u2019 court for yours.\n\nIACHIMO.\nMy humble thanks. I had almost forgot\nT\u2019 entreat your Grace but in a small request,\nAnd yet of moment too, for it concerns\nYour lord; myself and other noble friends\nAre partners in the business.\n\nIMOGEN.\nPray what is\u2019t?\n\nIACHIMO.\nSome dozen Romans of us, and your lord\n(The best feather of our wing) have mingled sums\nTo buy a present for the Emperor;\nWhich I, the factor for the rest, have done\nIn France. \u2019Tis plate of rare device, and jewels\nOf rich and exquisite form, their values great;\nAnd I am something curious, being strange,\nTo have them in safe stowage. May it please you\nTo take them in protection?\n\nIMOGEN.\nWillingly;\nAnd pawn mine honour for their safety. Since\nMy lord hath interest in them, I will keep them\nIn my bedchamber.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThey are in a trunk,\nAttended by my men. I will make bold\nTo send them to you only for this night;\nI must aboard tomorrow.\n\nIMOGEN.\nO, no, no.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYes, I beseech; or I shall short my word\nBy length\u2019ning my return. From Gallia\nI cross\u2019d the seas on purpose and on promise\nTo see your Grace.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI thank you for your pains.\nBut not away tomorrow!\n\nIACHIMO.\nO, I must, madam.\nTherefore I shall beseech you, if you please\nTo greet your lord with writing, do\u2019t tonight.\nI have outstood my time, which is material\nTo th\u2019 tender of our present.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI will write.\nSend your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept\nAnd truly yielded you. You\u2019re very welcome.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT II\n\nSCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Cloten and the two Lords.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWas there ever man had such luck! When I kiss\u2019d the jack, upon an\nupcast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on\u2019t; and then a whoreson\njackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I borrowed mine oaths of\nhim, and might not spend them at my pleasure.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nWhat got he by that? You have broke his pate with your bowl.\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] If his wit had been like him that broke it, it would have\nrun all out.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWhen a gentleman is dispos\u2019d to swear, it is not for any standers-by to\ncurtail his oaths. Ha?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nNo, my lord; [_Aside._] nor crop the ears of them.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWhoreson dog! I gave him satisfaction. Would he had been one of my\nrank!\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] To have smell\u2019d like a fool.\n\nCLOTEN.\nI am not vex\u2019d more at anything in th\u2019 earth. A pox on\u2019t! I had rather\nnot be so noble as I am; they dare not fight with me, because of the\nQueen my mother. Every jackslave hath his bellyful of fighting, and I\nmust go up and down like a cock that nobody can match.\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] You are cock and capon too; and you crow, cock, with your\ncomb on.\n\nCLOTEN.\nSayest thou?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIt is not fit your lordship should undertake every companion that you\ngive offence to.\n\nCLOTEN.\nNo, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offence to my inferiors.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nAy, it is fit for your lordship only.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWhy, so I say.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nDid you hear of a stranger that\u2019s come to court tonight?\n\nCLOTEN.\nA stranger, and I not known on\u2019t?\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] He\u2019s a strange fellow himself, and knows it not.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThere\u2019s an Italian come, and, \u2019tis thought, one of Leonatus\u2019 friends.\n\nCLOTEN.\nLeonatus? A banish\u2019d rascal; and he\u2019s another, whatsoever he be. Who\ntold you of this stranger?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nOne of your lordship\u2019s pages.\n\nCLOTEN.\nIs it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation in\u2019t?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nYou cannot derogate, my lord.\n\nCLOTEN.\nNot easily, I think.\n\nSECOND LORD.\n[_Aside._] You are a fool granted; therefore your issues, being\nfoolish, do not derogate.\n\nCLOTEN.\nCome, I\u2019ll go see this Italian. What I have lost today at bowls I\u2019ll\nwin tonight of him. Come, go.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI\u2019ll attend your lordship.\n\n [_Exeunt Cloten and First Lord._]\n\nThat such a crafty devil as is his mother\nShould yield the world this ass! A woman that\nBears all down with her brain; and this her son\nCannot take two from twenty, for his heart,\nAnd leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,\nThou divine Imogen, what thou endur\u2019st,\nBetwixt a father by thy step-dame govern\u2019d,\nA mother hourly coining plots, a wooer\nMore hateful than the foul expulsion is\nOf thy dear husband, than that horrid act\nOf the divorce he\u2019d make! The heavens hold firm\nThe walls of thy dear honour, keep unshak\u2019d\nThat temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand\nT\u2019 enjoy thy banish\u2019d lord and this great land!\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II.

My woman Helen?\n\nLADY.\nPlease you, madam.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat hour is it?\n\nLADY.\nAlmost midnight, madam.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak;\nFold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.\nTake not away the taper, leave it burning;\nAnd if thou canst awake by four o\u2019 th\u2019 clock,\nI prithee call me. Sleep hath seiz\u2019d me wholly.\n\n [_Exit Lady._]\n\nTo your protection I commend me, gods.\nFrom fairies and the tempters of the night\nGuard me, beseech ye!\n\n [_Sleeps. Iachimo comes from the trunk._]\n\nIACHIMO.\nThe crickets sing, and man\u2019s o\u2019er-labour\u2019d sense\nRepairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus\nDid softly press the rushes ere he waken\u2019d\nThe chastity he wounded. Cytherea,\nHow bravely thou becom\u2019st thy bed! fresh lily,\nAnd whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!\nBut kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon\u2019d,\nHow dearly they do\u2019t! \u2019Tis her breathing that\nPerfumes the chamber thus. The flame o\u2019 th\u2019 taper\nBows toward her and would under-peep her lids\nTo see th\u2019 enclosed lights, now canopied\nUnder these windows white and azure, lac\u2019d\nWith blue of heaven\u2019s own tinct. But my design\nTo note the chamber. I will write all down:\nSuch and such pictures; there the window; such\nTh\u2019 adornment of her bed; the arras, figures,\nWhy, such and such; and the contents o\u2019 th\u2019 story.\nAh, but some natural notes about her body\nAbove ten thousand meaner movables\nWould testify, t\u2019 enrich mine inventory.\nO sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!\nAnd be her sense but as a monument,\nThus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off;\n\n [_Taking off her bracelet._]\n\nAs slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!\n\u2019Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,\nAs strongly as the conscience does within,\nTo th\u2019 madding of her lord. On her left breast\nA mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops\nI\u2019 th\u2019 bottom of a cowslip. Here\u2019s a voucher\nStronger than ever law could make; this secret\nWill force him think I have pick\u2019d the lock and ta\u2019en\nThe treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?\nWhy should I write this down that\u2019s riveted,\nScrew\u2019d to my memory? She hath been reading late\nThe tale of Tereus; here the leaf\u2019s turn\u2019d down\nWhere Philomel gave up. I have enough.\nTo th\u2019 trunk again, and shut the spring of it.\nSwift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning\nMay bare the raven\u2019s eye! I lodge in fear;\nThough this a heavenly angel, hell is here.\n\n [_Clock strikes._]\n\nOne, two, three. Time, time!\n\n [_Exit into the trunk._]\n\nSCENE III. Cymbeline\u2019s palace. An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen\u2019s\napartments.\n\n Enter Cloten and Lords.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nYour lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most coldest that\never turn\u2019d up ace.\n\nCLOTEN.\nIt would make any man cold to lose.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nBut not every man patient after the noble temper of your lordship. You\nare most hot and furious when you win.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWinning will put any man into courage. If I could get this foolish\nImogen, I should have gold enough. It\u2019s almost morning, is\u2019t not?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nDay, my lord.\n\nCLOTEN.\nI would this music would come. I am advised to give her music a\nmornings; they say it will penetrate.\n\n Enter Musicians.\n\nCome on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your fingering, so. We\u2019ll\ntry with tongue too. If none will do, let her remain; but I\u2019ll never\ngive o\u2019er. First, a very excellent good-conceited thing; after, a\nwonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to it, and then let her\nconsider.\n\nSONG\n\n\n    Hark, hark! the lark at heaven\u2019s gate sings,\n        And Ph\u0153bus \u2019gins arise,\n    His steeds to water at those springs\n        On chalic\u2019d flow\u2019rs that lies;\n    And winking Mary-buds begin\n        To ope their golden eyes.\n    With everything that pretty is,\n        My lady sweet, arise;\n            Arise, arise!\n\nCLOTEN.\nSo, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music the\nbetter; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears which horsehairs and\ncalves\u2019 guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot, can never amend.\n\n [_Exeunt Musicians._]\n\n Enter Cymbeline and Queen.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHere comes the King.\n\nCLOTEN.\nI am glad I was up so late, for that\u2019s the reason I was up so early. He\ncannot choose but take this service I have done fatherly.\u2014Good morrow\nto your Majesty and to my gracious mother.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nAttend you here the door of our stern daughter?\nWill she not forth?\n\nCLOTEN.\nI have assail\u2019d her with musics, but she vouchsafes no notice.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThe exile of her minion is too new;\nShe hath not yet forgot him; some more time\nMust wear the print of his remembrance on\u2019t,\nAnd then she\u2019s yours.\n\nQUEEN.\nYou are most bound to th\u2019 King,\nWho lets go by no vantages that may\nPrefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself\nTo orderly solicits, and be friended\nWith aptness of the season; make denials\nIncrease your services; so seem as if\nYou were inspir\u2019d to do those duties which\nYou tender to her; that you in all obey her,\nSave when command to your dismission tends,\nAnd therein you are senseless.\n\nCLOTEN.\nSenseless? Not so.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nSo like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;\nThe one is Caius Lucius.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nA worthy fellow,\nAlbeit he comes on angry purpose now;\nBut that\u2019s no fault of his. We must receive him\nAccording to the honour of his sender;\nAnd towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,\nWe must extend our notice. Our dear son,\nWhen you have given good morning to your mistress,\nAttend the Queen and us; we shall have need\nT\u2019 employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.\n\n [_Exeunt all but Cloten._]\n\nCLOTEN.\nIf she be up, I\u2019ll speak with her; if not,\nLet her lie still and dream. By your leave, ho!\n\n [_Knocks._]\n\nI know her women are about her; what\nIf I do line one of their hands? \u2019Tis gold\nWhich buys admittance (oft it doth) yea, and makes\nDiana\u2019s rangers false themselves, yield up\nTheir deer to th\u2019 stand o\u2019 th\u2019 stealer; and \u2019tis gold\nWhich makes the true man kill\u2019d and saves the thief;\nNay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What\nCan it not do and undo? I will make\nOne of her women lawyer to me, for\nI yet not understand the case myself.\nBy your leave.\n\n [_Knocks._]\n\n Enter a Lady.\n\nLADY.\nWho\u2019s there that knocks?\n\nCLOTEN.\nA gentleman.\n\nLADY.\nNo more?\n\nCLOTEN.\nYes, and a gentlewoman\u2019s son.\n\nLADY.\nThat\u2019s more\nThan some whose tailors are as dear as yours\nCan justly boast of. What\u2019s your lordship\u2019s pleasure?\n\nCLOTEN.\nYour lady\u2019s person; is she ready?\n\nLADY.\nAy,\nTo keep her chamber.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThere is gold for you; sell me your good report.\n\nLADY.\nHow? My good name? or to report of you\nWhat I shall think is good? The Princess!\n\n Enter Imogen.\n\nCLOTEN.\nGood morrow, fairest sister. Your sweet hand.\n\n [_Exit Lady._]\n\nIMOGEN.\nGood morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains\nFor purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give\nIs telling you that I am poor of thanks,\nAnd scarce can spare them.\n\nCLOTEN.\nStill I swear I love you.\n\nIMOGEN.\nIf you but said so, \u2019twere as deep with me.\nIf you swear still, your recompense is still\nThat I regard it not.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThis is no answer.\n\nIMOGEN.\nBut that you shall not say I yield, being silent,\nI would not speak. I pray you spare me. Faith,\nI shall unfold equal discourtesy\nTo your best kindness; one of your great knowing\nShould learn, being taught, forbearance.\n\nCLOTEN.\nTo leave you in your madness \u2019twere my sin;\nI will not.\n\nIMOGEN.\nFools are not mad folks.\n\nCLOTEN.\nDo you call me fool?\n\nIMOGEN.\nAs I am mad, I do;\nIf you\u2019ll be patient, I\u2019ll no more be mad;\nThat cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,\nYou put me to forget a lady\u2019s manners\nBy being so verbal; and learn now, for all,\nThat I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,\nBy th\u2019 very truth of it, I care not for you,\nAnd am so near the lack of charity\nTo accuse myself I hate you; which I had rather\nYou felt than make\u2019t my boast.\n\nCLOTEN.\nYou sin against\nObedience, which you owe your father. For\nThe contract you pretend with that base wretch,\nOne bred of alms and foster\u2019d with cold dishes,\nWith scraps o\u2019 th\u2019 court, it is no contract, none.\nAnd though it be allowed in meaner parties\n(Yet who than he more mean?) to knit their souls\n(On whom there is no more dependency\nBut brats and beggary) in self-figur\u2019d knot,\nYet you are curb\u2019d from that enlargement by\nThe consequence o\u2019 th\u2019 crown, and must not foil\nThe precious note of it with a base slave,\nA hilding for a livery, a squire\u2019s cloth,\nA pantler; not so eminent!\n\nIMOGEN.\nProfane fellow!\nWert thou the son of Jupiter, and no more\nBut what thou art besides, thou wert too base\nTo be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,\nEven to the point of envy, if \u2019twere made\nComparative for your virtues to be styl\u2019d\nThe under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated\nFor being preferr\u2019d so well.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThe south fog rot him!\n\nIMOGEN.\nHe never can meet more mischance than come\nTo be but nam\u2019d of thee. His mean\u2019st garment\nThat ever hath but clipp\u2019d his body, is dearer\nIn my respect, than all the hairs above thee,\nWere they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!\n\n Enter Pisanio.\n\nCLOTEN.\n\u2018His garment\u2019! Now the devil\u2014\n\nIMOGEN.\nTo Dorothy my woman hie thee presently.\n\nCLOTEN.\n\u2018His garment\u2019!\n\nIMOGEN.\nI am sprited with a fool;\nFrighted, and ang\u2019red worse. Go bid my woman\nSearch for a jewel that too casually\nHath left mine arm. It was thy master\u2019s; shrew me,\nIf I would lose it for a revenue\nOf any king\u2019s in Europe! I do think\nI saw\u2019t this morning; confident I am\nLast night \u2019twas on mine arm; I kiss\u2019d it.\nI hope it be not gone to tell my lord\nThat I kiss aught but he.\n\nPISANIO.\n\u2019Twill not be lost.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI hope so. Go and search.\n\n [_Exit Pisanio._]\n\nCLOTEN.\nYou have abus\u2019d me.\n\u2018His meanest garment\u2019!\n\nIMOGEN.\nAy, I said so, sir.\nIf you will make \u2019t an action, call witness to \u2019t.\n\nCLOTEN.\nI will inform your father.\n\nIMOGEN.\nYour mother too.\nShe\u2019s my good lady and will conceive, I hope,\nBut the worst of me. So I leave you, sir,\nTo th\u2019 worst of discontent.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nCLOTEN.\nI\u2019ll be reveng\u2019d.\n\u2018His mean\u2019st garment\u2019! Well.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE IV. Rome. Philario\u2019s house.\n\n Enter Posthumus and Philario.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nFear it not, sir; I would I were so sure\nTo win the King as I am bold her honour\nWill remain hers.\n\nPHILARIO.\nWhat means do you make to him?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nNot any; but abide the change of time,\nQuake in the present winter\u2019s state, and wish\nThat warmer days would come. In these fear\u2019d hopes\nI barely gratify your love; they failing,\nI must die much your debtor.\n\nPHILARIO.\nYour very goodness and your company\nO\u2019erpays all I can do. By this your king\nHath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius\nWill do\u2019s commission throughly; and I think\nHe\u2019ll grant the tribute, send th\u2019 arrearages,\nOr look upon our Romans, whose remembrance\nIs yet fresh in their grief.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI do believe\nStatist though I am none, nor like to be,\nThat this will prove a war; and you shall hear\nThe legions now in Gallia sooner landed\nIn our not-fearing Britain than have tidings\nOf any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen\nAre men more order\u2019d than when Julius C\u00e6sar\nSmil\u2019d at their lack of skill, but found their courage\nWorthy his frowning at. Their discipline,\nNow mingled with their courages, will make known\nTo their approvers they are people such\nThat mend upon the world.\n\n Enter Iachimo.\n\nPHILARIO.\nSee! Iachimo!\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThe swiftest harts have posted you by land,\nAnd winds of all the corners kiss\u2019d your sails,\nTo make your vessel nimble.\n\nPHILARIO.\nWelcome, sir.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI hope the briefness of your answer made\nThe speediness of your return.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYour lady\nIs one of the fairest that I have look\u2019d upon.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nAnd therewithal the best; or let her beauty\nLook through a casement to allure false hearts,\nAnd be false with them.\n\nIACHIMO.\nHere are letters for you.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nTheir tenour good, I trust.\n\nIACHIMO.\n\u2019Tis very like.\n\nPHILARIO.\nWas Caius Lucius in the Britain court\nWhen you were there?\n\nIACHIMO.\nHe was expected then,\nBut not approach\u2019d.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nAll is well yet.\nSparkles this stone as it was wont, or is\u2019t not\nToo dull for your good wearing?\n\nIACHIMO.\nIf I have lost it,\nI should have lost the worth of it in gold.\nI\u2019ll make a journey twice as far t\u2019 enjoy\nA second night of such sweet shortness which\nWas mine in Britain; for the ring is won.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThe stone\u2019s too hard to come by.\n\nIACHIMO.\nNot a whit,\nYour lady being so easy.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nMake not, sir,\nYour loss your sport. I hope you know that we\nMust not continue friends.\n\nIACHIMO.\nGood sir, we must,\nIf you keep covenant. Had I not brought\nThe knowledge of your mistress home, I grant\nWe were to question farther; but I now\nProfess myself the winner of her honour,\nTogether with your ring; and not the wronger\nOf her or you, having proceeded but\nBy both your wills.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nIf you can make\u2019t apparent\nThat you have tasted her in bed, my hand\nAnd ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion\nYou had of her pure honour gains or loses\nYour sword or mine, or masterless leaves both\nTo who shall find them.\n\nIACHIMO.\nSir, my circumstances,\nBeing so near the truth as I will make them,\nMust first induce you to believe; whose strength\nI will confirm with oath; which I doubt not\nYou\u2019ll give me leave to spare when you shall find\nYou need it not.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nProceed.\n\nIACHIMO.\nFirst, her bedchamber,\n(Where I confess I slept not, but profess\nHad that was well worth watching) it was hang\u2019d\nWith tapestry of silk and silver; the story,\nProud Cleopatra when she met her Roman\nAnd Cydnus swell\u2019d above the banks, or for\nThe press of boats or pride. A piece of work\nSo bravely done, so rich, that it did strive\nIn workmanship and value; which I wonder\u2019d\nCould be so rarely and exactly wrought,\nSince the true life on\u2019t was\u2014\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThis is true;\nAnd this you might have heard of here, by me\nOr by some other.\n\nIACHIMO.\nMore particulars\nMust justify my knowledge.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nSo they must,\nOr do your honour injury.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThe chimney\nIs south the chamber, and the chimneypiece\nChaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures\nSo likely to report themselves. The cutter\nWas as another nature, dumb; outwent her,\nMotion and breath left out.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThis is a thing\nWhich you might from relation likewise reap,\nBeing, as it is, much spoke of.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThe roof o\u2019 th\u2019 chamber\nWith golden cherubins is fretted; her andirons\n(I had forgot them) were two winking Cupids\nOf silver, each on one foot standing, nicely\nDepending on their brands.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThis is her honour!\nLet it be granted you have seen all this, and praise\nBe given to your remembrance; the description\nOf what is in her chamber nothing saves\nThe wager you have laid.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThen, if you can, [_Shows the bracelet_]\nBe pale. I beg but leave to air this jewel. See!\nAnd now \u2019tis up again. It must be married\nTo that your diamond; I\u2019ll keep them.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nJove!\nOnce more let me behold it. Is it that\nWhich I left with her?\n\nIACHIMO.\nSir (I thank her) that.\nShe stripp\u2019d it from her arm; I see her yet;\nHer pretty action did outsell her gift,\nAnd yet enrich\u2019d it too. She gave it me, and said\nShe priz\u2019d it once.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nMay be she pluck\u2019d it of\nTo send it me.\n\nIACHIMO.\nShe writes so to you, doth she?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nO, no, no, no! \u2019tis true. Here, take this too;\n\n [_Gives the ring._]\n\nIt is a basilisk unto mine eye,\nKills me to look on\u2019t. Let there be no honour\nWhere there is beauty; truth where semblance; love\nWhere there\u2019s another man. The vows of women\nOf no more bondage be to where they are made\nThan they are to their virtues, which is nothing.\nO, above measure false!\n\nPHILARIO.\nHave patience, sir,\nAnd take your ring again; \u2019tis not yet won.\nIt may be probable she lost it, or\nWho knows if one her women, being corrupted\nHath stol\u2019n it from her?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nVery true;\nAnd so I hope he came by\u2019t. Back my ring.\nRender to me some corporal sign about her,\nMore evident than this; for this was stol\u2019n.\n\nIACHIMO.\nBy Jupiter, I had it from her arm!\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nHark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.\n\u2019Tis true, nay, keep the ring, \u2019tis true. I am sure\nShe would not lose it. Her attendants are\nAll sworn and honourable:\u2014they induc\u2019d to steal it!\nAnd by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy\u2019d her.\nThe cognizance of her incontinency\nIs this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.\nThere, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell\nDivide themselves between you!\n\n\nPHILARIO.\nSir, be patient;\nThis is not strong enough to be believ\u2019d\nOf one persuaded well of.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nNever talk on\u2019t;\nShe hath been colted by him.\n\nIACHIMO.\nIf you seek\nFor further satisfying, under her breast\n(Worthy the pressing) lies a mole, right proud\nOf that most delicate lodging. By my life,\nI kiss\u2019d it; and it gave me present hunger\nTo feed again, though full. You do remember\nThis stain upon her?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nAy, and it doth confirm\nAnother stain, as big as hell can hold,\nWere there no more but it.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWill you hear more?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nSpare your arithmetic; never count the turns.\nOnce, and a million!\n\nIACHIMO.\nI\u2019ll be sworn\u2014\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nNo swearing.\nIf you will swear you have not done\u2019t, you lie;\nAnd I will kill thee if thou dost deny\nThou\u2019st made me cuckold.\n\nIACHIMO.\nI\u2019ll deny nothing.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nO that I had her here to tear her limb-meal!\nI will go there and do\u2019t, i\u2019 th\u2019 court, before\nHer father. I\u2019ll do something\u2014\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPHILARIO.\nQuite besides\nThe government of patience! You have won.\nLet\u2019s follow him and pervert the present wrath\nHe hath against himself.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWith all my heart.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Rome. Another room in Philario\u2019s house.\n\n Enter Posthumus.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nIs there no way for men to be, but women\nMust be half-workers? We are all bastards,\nAnd that most venerable man which I\nDid call my father was I know not where\nWhen I was stamp\u2019d. Some coiner with his tools\nMade me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem\u2019d\nThe Dian of that time. So doth my wife\nThe nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!\nMe of my lawful pleasure she restrain\u2019d,\nAnd pray\u2019d me oft forbearance; did it with\nA pudency so rosy, the sweet view on\u2019t\nMight well have warm\u2019d old Saturn; that I thought her\nAs chaste as unsunn\u2019d snow. O, all the devils!\nThis yellow Iachimo in an hour, was\u2019t not?\nOr less; at first? Perchance he spoke not, but,\nLike a full-acorn\u2019d boar, a German one,\nCried \u201cO!\u201d and mounted; found no opposition\nBut what he look\u2019d for should oppose and she\nShould from encounter guard. Could I find out\nThe woman\u2019s part in me! For there\u2019s no motion\nThat tends to vice in man but I affirm\nIt is the woman\u2019s part. Be it lying, note it,\nThe woman\u2019s; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;\nLust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;\nAmbitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,\nNice longing, slanders, mutability,\nAll faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,\nWhy, hers, in part or all; but rather all;\nFor even to vice\nThey are not constant, but are changing still\nOne vice but of a minute old for one\nNot half so old as that. I\u2019ll write against them,\nDetest them, curse them. Yet \u2019tis greater skill\nIn a true hate to pray they have their will:\nThe very devils cannot plague them better.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\nACT III\n\nSCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter in state Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten and Lords at one door, and at\n another Caius Lucius and Attendants.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nNow say, what would Augustus C\u00e6sar with us?\n\nLUCIUS.\nWhen Julius C\u00e6sar, (whose remembrance yet\nLives in men\u2019s eyes, and will to ears and tongues\nBe theme and hearing ever) was in this Britain,\nAnd conquer\u2019d it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,\nFamous in C\u00e6sar\u2019s praises no whit less\nThan in his feats deserving it, for him\nAnd his succession granted Rome a tribute,\nYearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately\nIs left untender\u2019d.\n\nQUEEN.\nAnd, to kill the marvel,\nShall be so ever.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThere be many C\u00e6sars ere such another Julius. Britain is a world by\nitself, and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses.\n\nQUEEN.\nThat opportunity,\nWhich then they had to take from\u2019s, to resume\nWe have again. Remember, sir, my liege,\nThe kings your ancestors, together with\nThe natural bravery of your isle, which stands\nAs Neptune\u2019s park, ribb\u2019d and pal\u2019d in\nWith rocks unscaleable and roaring waters,\nWith sands that will not bear your enemies\u2019 boats\nBut suck them up to th\u2019 top-mast. A kind of conquest\nC\u00e6sar made here, but made not here his brag\nOf \u2018Came, and saw, and overcame.\u2019 With shame\n(The first that ever touch\u2019d him) he was carried\nFrom off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping\n(Poor ignorant baubles!) on our terrible seas,\nLike egg-shells mov\u2019d upon their surges, crack\u2019d\nAs easily \u2019gainst our rocks; for joy whereof\nThe fam\u2019d Cassibelan, who was once at point\n(O, giglot fortune!) to master C\u00e6sar\u2019s sword,\nMade Lud\u2019s Town with rejoicing fires bright\nAnd Britons strut with courage.\n\nCLOTEN.\nCome, there\u2019s no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than\nit was at that time; and, as I said, there is no moe such C\u00e6sars. Other\nof them may have crook\u2019d noses; but to owe such straight arms, none.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nSon, let your mother end.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWe have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan. I do not say\nI am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If\nC\u00e6sar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or put the moon in his\npocket, we will pay him tribute for light; else, sir, no more tribute,\npray you now.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nYou must know,\nTill the injurious Romans did extort\nThis tribute from us, we were free. C\u00e6sar\u2019s ambition,\nWhich swell\u2019d so much that it did almost stretch\nThe sides o\u2019 th\u2019 world, against all colour here\nDid put the yoke upon\u2019s; which to shake of\nBecomes a warlike people, whom we reckon\nOurselves to be.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWe do.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nSay then to C\u00e6sar,\nOur ancestor was that Mulmutius which\nOrdain\u2019d our laws, whose use the sword of C\u00e6sar\nHath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise\nShall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,\nThough Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,\nWho was the first of Britain which did put\nHis brows within a golden crown, and call\u2019d\nHimself a king.\n\nLUCIUS.\nI am sorry, Cymbeline,\nThat I am to pronounce Augustus C\u00e6sar\n(C\u00e6sar, that hath moe kings his servants than\nThyself domestic officers) thine enemy.\nReceive it from me, then: war and confusion\nIn C\u00e6sar\u2019s name pronounce I \u2019gainst thee; look\nFor fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,\nI thank thee for myself.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThou art welcome, Caius.\nThy C\u00e6sar knighted me; my youth I spent\nMuch under him; of him I gather\u2019d honour,\nWhich he to seek of me again, perforce,\nBehoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect\nThat the Pannonians and Dalmatians for\nTheir liberties are now in arms, a precedent\nWhich not to read would show the Britons cold;\nSo C\u00e6sar shall not find them.\n\nLUCIUS.\nLet proof speak.\n\nCLOTEN.\nHis majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or two, or\nlonger. If you seek us afterwards in other terms, you shall find us in\nour salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it, it is yours; if you\nfall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the better for you; and\nthere\u2019s an end.\n\nLUCIUS.\nSo, sir.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nI know your master\u2019s pleasure, and he mine;\nAll the remain is, welcome.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Britain. Another room in Cymbeline\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Pisanio reading of a letter.\n\nPISANIO.\nHow? of adultery? Wherefore write you not\nWhat monsters her accuse? Leonatus!\nO master, what a strange infection\nIs fall\u2019n into thy ear! What false Italian\n(As poisonous-tongu\u2019d as handed) hath prevail\u2019d\nOn thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.\nShe\u2019s punish\u2019d for her truth, and undergoes,\nMore goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults\nAs would take in some virtue. O my master,\nThy mind to her is now as low as were\nThy fortunes. How? that I should murder her?\nUpon the love, and truth, and vows, which I\nHave made to thy command? I, her? Her blood?\nIf it be so to do good service, never\nLet me be counted serviceable. How look I\nThat I should seem to lack humanity\nSo much as this fact comes to?\n\n [_Reads._]\n\n\u2018Do\u2019t. The letter\nThat I have sent her, by her own command\nShall give thee opportunity.\u2019 O damn\u2019d paper,\nBlack as the ink that\u2019s on thee! Senseless bauble,\nArt thou a fedary for this act, and look\u2019st\nSo virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.\n\n Enter Imogen.\n\nI am ignorant in what I am commanded.\n\nIMOGEN.\nHow now, Pisanio?\n\nPISANIO.\nMadam, here is a letter from my lord.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWho? thy lord? That is my lord, Leonatus?\nO, learn\u2019d indeed were that astronomer\nThat knew the stars as I his characters;\nHe\u2019d lay the future open. You good gods,\nLet what is here contain\u2019d relish of love,\nOf my lord\u2019s health, of his content; yet not\nThat we two are asunder; let that grieve him!\nSome griefs are med\u2019cinable; that is one of them,\nFor it doth physic love: of his content,\nAll but in that. Good wax, thy leave. Blest be\nYou bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers\nAnd men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;\nThough forfeiters you cast in prison, yet\nYou clasp young Cupid\u2019s tables. Good news, gods!\n\n [_Reads._]\n\n_Justice and your father\u2019s wrath, should he take me in his dominion,\ncould not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of creatures, would\neven renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria, at\nMilford Haven. What your own love will out of this advise you, follow.\nSo he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow, and your\nincreasing in love.\n                    LEONATUS POSTHUMUS._\n\nO for a horse with wings! Hear\u2019st thou, Pisanio?\nHe is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me\nHow far \u2019tis thither. If one of mean affairs\nMay plod it in a week, why may not I\nGlide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,\nWho long\u2019st like me to see thy lord, who long\u2019st\n(O, let me \u2019bate!) but not like me, yet long\u2019st,\nBut in a fainter kind. O, not like me,\nFor mine\u2019s beyond beyond: say, and speak thick,\n(Love\u2019s counsellor should fill the bores of hearing\nTo th\u2019 smothering of the sense) how far it is\nTo this same blessed Milford. And by th\u2019 way\nTell me how Wales was made so happy as\nT\u2019 inherit such a haven. But first of all,\nHow we may steal from hence; and for the gap\nThat we shall make in time from our hence-going\nAnd our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence.\nWhy should excuse be born or ere begot?\nWe\u2019ll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,\nHow many score of miles may we well rid\n\u2019Twixt hour and hour?\n\nPISANIO.\nOne score \u2019twixt sun and sun,\nMadam, \u2019s enough for you, and too much too.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhy, one that rode to\u2019s execution, man,\nCould never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers\nWhere horses have been nimbler than the sands\nThat run i\u2019 th\u2019 clock\u2019s behalf. But this is fool\u2019ry.\nGo bid my woman feign a sickness; say\nShe\u2019ll home to her father; and provide me presently\nA riding suit, no costlier than would fit\nA franklin\u2019s huswife.\n\nPISANIO.\nMadam, you\u2019re best consider.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI see before me, man. Nor here, nor here,\nNor what ensues, but have a fog in them\nThat I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;\nDo as I bid thee. There\u2019s no more to say.\nAccessible is none but Milford way.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Wales. A mountainous country with a cave.\n\n Enter from the cave Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.\n\nBELARIUS.\nA goodly day not to keep house with such\nWhose roof\u2019s as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate\nInstructs you how t\u2019 adore the heavens, and bows you\nTo a morning\u2019s holy office. The gates of monarchs\nAre arch\u2019d so high that giants may jet through\nAnd keep their impious turbans on without\nGood morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!\nWe house i\u2019 th\u2019 rock, yet use thee not so hardly\nAs prouder livers do.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nHail, heaven!\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nHail, heaven!\n\nBELARIUS.\nNow for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill,\nYour legs are young; I\u2019ll tread these flats. Consider,\nWhen you above perceive me like a crow,\nThat it is place which lessens and sets off;\nAnd you may then revolve what tales I have told you\nOf courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.\nThis service is not service so being done,\nBut being so allow\u2019d. To apprehend thus\nDraws us a profit from all things we see,\nAnd often to our comfort shall we find\nThe sharded beetle in a safer hold\nThan is the full-wing\u2019d eagle. O, this life\nIs nobler than attending for a check,\nRicher than doing nothing for a robe,\nProuder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:\nSuch gain the cap of him that makes him fine,\nYet keeps his book uncross\u2019d. No life to ours!\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nOut of your proof you speak. We, poor unfledg\u2019d,\nHave never wing\u2019d from view o\u2019 th\u2019 nest, nor know not\nWhat air\u2019s from home. Haply this life is best,\nIf quiet life be best; sweeter to you\nThat have a sharper known; well corresponding\nWith your stiff age. But unto us it is\nA cell of ignorance, travelling abed,\nA prison for a debtor that not dares\nTo stride a limit.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWhat should we speak of\nWhen we are old as you? When we shall hear\nThe rain and wind beat dark December, how,\nIn this our pinching cave, shall we discourse.\nThe freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;\nWe are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,\nLike warlike as the wolf for what we eat.\nOur valour is to chase what flies; our cage\nWe make a choir, as doth the prison\u2019d bird,\nAnd sing our bondage freely.\n\nBELARIUS.\nHow you speak!\nDid you but know the city\u2019s usuries,\nAnd felt them knowingly; the art o\u2019 th\u2019 court,\nAs hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb\nIs certain falling, or so slipp\u2019ry that\nThe fear\u2019s as bad as falling; the toil o\u2019 th\u2019 war,\nA pain that only seems to seek out danger\nI\u2019 th\u2019 name of fame and honour, which dies i\u2019 th\u2019 search,\nAnd hath as oft a sland\u2019rous epitaph\nAs record of fair act; nay, many times,\nDoth ill deserve by doing well; what\u2019s worse,\nMust curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this story\nThe world may read in me; my body\u2019s mark\u2019d\nWith Roman swords, and my report was once\nFirst with the best of note. Cymbeline lov\u2019d me;\nAnd when a soldier was the theme, my name\nWas not far off. Then was I as a tree\nWhose boughs did bend with fruit. But in one night\nA storm, or robbery, call it what you will,\nShook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,\nAnd left me bare to weather.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nUncertain favour!\n\nBELARIUS.\nMy fault being nothing, as I have told you oft,\nBut that two villains, whose false oaths prevail\u2019d\nBefore my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline\nI was confederate with the Romans. So\nFollow\u2019d my banishment, and this twenty years\nThis rock and these demesnes have been my world,\nWhere I have liv\u2019d at honest freedom, paid\nMore pious debts to heaven than in all\nThe fore-end of my time. But up to th\u2019 mountains!\nThis is not hunters\u2019 language. He that strikes\nThe venison first shall be the lord o\u2019 th\u2019 feast;\nTo him the other two shall minister;\nAnd we will fear no poison, which attends\nIn place of greater state. I\u2019ll meet you in the valleys.\n\n [_Exeunt Guiderius and Arviragus._]\n\nHow hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!\nThese boys know little they are sons to th\u2019 King,\nNor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.\nThey think they are mine; and though train\u2019d up thus meanly\nI\u2019 th\u2019 cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit\nThe roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them\nIn simple and low things to prince it much\nBeyond the trick of others. This Polydore,\nThe heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who\nThe King his father call\u2019d Guiderius\u2014Jove!\nWhen on my three-foot stool I sit and tell\nThe warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out\nInto my story; say \u2018Thus mine enemy fell,\nAnd thus I set my foot on\u2019s neck\u2019; even then\nThe princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,\nStrains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture\nThat acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,\nOnce Arviragus, in as like a figure\nStrikes life into my speech, and shows much more\nHis own conceiving. Hark, the game is rous\u2019d!\nO Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows\nThou didst unjustly banish me! Whereon,\nAt three and two years old, I stole these babes,\nThinking to bar thee of succession as\nThou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,\nThou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,\nAnd every day do honour to her grave.\nMyself, Belarius, that am Morgan call\u2019d,\nThey take for natural father. The game is up.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE IV. Wales, near Milford Haven.\n\n Enter Pisanio and Imogen.\n\nIMOGEN.\nThou told\u2019st me, when we came from horse, the place\nWas near at hand. Ne\u2019er long\u2019d my mother so\nTo see me first as I have now. Pisanio! Man!\nWhere is Posthumus? What is in thy mind\nThat makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh\nFrom th\u2019 inward of thee? One but painted thus\nWould be interpreted a thing perplex\u2019d\nBeyond self-explication. Put thyself\nInto a haviour of less fear, ere wildness\nVanquish my staider senses. What\u2019s the matter?\nWhy tender\u2019st thou that paper to me with\nA look untender? If\u2019t be summer news,\nSmile to\u2019t before; if winterly, thou need\u2019st\nBut keep that count\u2019nance still. My husband\u2019s hand?\nThat drug-damn\u2019d Italy hath out-craftied him,\nAnd he\u2019s at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue\nMay take off some extremity, which to read\nWould be even mortal to me.\n\nPISANIO.\nPlease you read,\nAnd you shall find me, wretched man, a thing\nThe most disdain\u2019d of fortune.\n\nIMOGEN.\n[_Reads._] _Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath play\u2019d the strumpet in my bed,\nthe testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak\nsurmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I\nexpect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act for me, if thy\nfaith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take\naway her life; I shall give thee opportunity at Milford Haven; she hath\nmy letter for the purpose; where, if thou fear to strike, and to make\nme certain it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour, and\nequally to me disloyal._\n\nPISANIO.\nWhat shall I need to draw my sword? The paper\nHath cut her throat already. No, \u2019tis slander,\nWhose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue\nOutvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath\nRides on the posting winds and doth belie\nAll corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,\nMaids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave,\nThis viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?\n\nIMOGEN.\nFalse to his bed? What is it to be false?\nTo lie in watch there, and to think on him?\nTo weep twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,\nTo break it with a fearful dream of him,\nAnd cry myself awake? That\u2019s false to\u2019s bed,\nIs it?\n\nPISANIO.\nAlas, good lady!\n\nIMOGEN.\nI false! Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,\nThou didst accuse him of incontinency;\nThou then look\u2019dst like a villain; now, methinks,\nThy favour\u2019s good enough. Some jay of Italy,\nWhose mother was her painting, hath betray\u2019d him.\nPoor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,\nAnd for I am richer than to hang by th\u2019 walls\nI must be ripp\u2019d. To pieces with me! O,\nMen\u2019s vows are women\u2019s traitors! All good seeming,\nBy thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought\nPut on for villainy; not born where\u2019t grows,\nBut worn a bait for ladies.\n\nPISANIO.\nGood madam, hear me.\n\nIMOGEN.\nTrue honest men being heard, like false \u00c6neas,\nWere, in his time, thought false; and Sinon\u2019s weeping\nDid scandal many a holy tear, took pity\nFrom most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus,\nWilt lay the leaven on all proper men:\nGoodly and gallant shall be false and perjur\u2019d\nFrom thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest;\nDo thou thy master\u2019s bidding; when thou seest him,\nA little witness my obedience. Look!\nI draw the sword myself; take it, and hit\nThe innocent mansion of my love, my heart.\nFear not; \u2019tis empty of all things but grief;\nThy master is not there, who was indeed\nThe riches of it. Do his bidding; strike.\nThou mayst be valiant in a better cause,\nBut now thou seem\u2019st a coward.\n\nPISANIO.\nHence, vile instrument!\nThou shalt not damn my hand.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhy, I must die;\nAnd if I do not by thy hand, thou art\nNo servant of thy master\u2019s. Against self-slaughter\nThere is a prohibition so divine\nThat cravens my weak hand. Come, here\u2019s my heart:\nSomething\u2019s afore\u2019t. Soft, soft! we\u2019ll no defence,\nObedient as the scabbard. What is here?\nThe scriptures of the loyal Leonatus\nAll turn\u2019d to heresy? Away, away,\nCorrupters of my faith, you shall no more\nBe stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools\nBelieve false teachers; though those that are betray\u2019d\nDo feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor\nStands in worse case of woe. And thou, Posthumus,\nThat didst set up my disobedience \u2019gainst the King\nMy father, and make me put into contempt the suits\nOf princely fellows, shalt hereafter find\nIt is no act of common passage but\nA strain of rareness; and I grieve myself\nTo think, when thou shalt be disedg\u2019d by her\nThat now thou tirest on, how thy memory\nWill then be pang\u2019d by me. Prithee dispatch.\nThe lamp entreats the butcher. Where\u2019s thy knife?\nThou art too slow to do thy master\u2019s bidding,\nWhen I desire it too.\n\nPISANIO.\nO gracious lady,\nSince I receiv\u2019d command to do this busines\nI have not slept one wink.\n\nIMOGEN.\nDo\u2019t, and to bed then.\n\nPISANIO.\nI\u2019ll wake mine eyeballs first.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWherefore then\nDidst undertake it? Why hast thou abus\u2019d\nSo many miles with a pretence? This place?\nMine action and thine own? our horses\u2019 labour?\nThe time inviting thee? The perturb\u2019d court,\nFor my being absent? whereunto I never\nPurpose return. Why hast thou gone so far\nTo be unbent when thou hast ta\u2019en thy stand,\nTh\u2019 elected deer before thee?\n\nPISANIO.\nBut to win time\nTo lose so bad employment, in the which\nI have consider\u2019d of a course. Good lady,\nHear me with patience.\n\nIMOGEN.\nTalk thy tongue weary, speak.\nI have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear,\nTherein false struck, can take no greater wound,\nNor tent to bottom that. But speak.\n\nPISANIO.\nThen, madam,\nI thought you would not back again.\n\nIMOGEN.\nMost like,\nBringing me here to kill me.\n\nPISANIO.\nNot so, neither;\nBut if I were as wise as honest, then\nMy purpose would prove well. It cannot be\nBut that my master is abus\u2019d. Some villain,\nAy, and singular in his art, hath done you both\nThis cursed injury.\n\nIMOGEN.\nSome Roman courtezan!\n\nPISANIO.\nNo, on my life!\nI\u2019ll give but notice you are dead, and send him\nSome bloody sign of it, for \u2019tis commanded\nI should do so. You shall be miss\u2019d at court,\nAnd that will well confirm it.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhy, good fellow,\nWhat shall I do the while? Where bide? How live?\nOr in my life what comfort, when I am\nDead to my husband?\n\nPISANIO.\nIf you\u2019ll back to th\u2019 court\u2014\n\nIMOGEN.\nNo court, no father, nor no more ado\nWith that harsh, noble, simple nothing,\nThat Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me\nAs fearful as a siege.\n\nPISANIO.\nIf not at court,\nThen not in Britain must you bide.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhere then?\nHath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,\nAre they not but in Britain? I\u2019 th\u2019 world\u2019s volume\nOur Britain seems as of it, but not in\u2019t;\nIn a great pool a swan\u2019s nest. Prithee think\nThere\u2019s livers out of Britain.\n\nPISANIO.\nI am most glad\nYou think of other place. Th\u2019 ambassador,\nLucius the Roman, comes to Milford Haven\nTomorrow. Now, if you could wear a mind\nDark as your fortune is, and but disguise\nThat which t\u2019 appear itself must not yet be\nBut by self-danger, you should tread a course\nPretty and full of view; yea, happily, near\nThe residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least,\nThat though his actions were not visible, yet\nReport should render him hourly to your ear\nAs truly as he moves.\n\nIMOGEN.\nO! for such means,\nThough peril to my modesty, not death on\u2019t,\nI would adventure.\n\nPISANIO.\nWell then, here\u2019s the point:\nYou must forget to be a woman; change\nCommand into obedience; fear and niceness\n(The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,\nWoman it pretty self) into a waggish courage;\nReady in gibes, quick-answer\u2019d, saucy, and\nAs quarrelous as the weasel. Nay, you must\nForget that rarest treasure of your cheek,\nExposing it (but, O, the harder heart!\nAlack, no remedy) to the greedy touch\nOf common-kissing Titan, and forget\nYour laboursome and dainty trims wherein\nYou made great Juno angry.\n\nIMOGEN.\nNay, be brief;\nI see into thy end, and am almost\nA man already.\n\nPISANIO.\nFirst, make yourself but like one.\nFore-thinking this, I have already fit\n(\u2019Tis in my cloak-bag) doublet, hat, hose, all\nThat answer to them. Would you, in their serving,\nAnd with what imitation you can borrow\nFrom youth of such a season, \u2019fore noble Lucius\nPresent yourself, desire his service, tell him\nWherein you\u2019re happy; which will make him know\nIf that his head have ear in music; doubtless\nWith joy he will embrace you; for he\u2019s honourable,\nAnd, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad:\nYou have me, rich; and I will never fail\nBeginning nor supplyment.\n\nIMOGEN.\nThou art all the comfort\nThe gods will diet me with. Prithee away!\nThere\u2019s more to be consider\u2019d; but we\u2019ll even\nAll that good time will give us. This attempt\nI am soldier to, and will abide it with\nA prince\u2019s courage. Away, I prithee.\n\nPISANIO.\nWell, madam, we must take a short farewell,\nLest, being miss\u2019d, I be suspected of\nYour carriage from the court. My noble mistress,\nHere is a box; I had it from the Queen.\nWhat\u2019s in\u2019t is precious. If you are sick at sea\nOr stomach-qualm\u2019d at land, a dram of this\nWill drive away distemper. To some shade,\nAnd fit you to your manhood. May the gods\nDirect you to the best!\n\nIMOGEN.\nAmen. I thank thee.\n\n [_Exeunt severally._]\n\nSCENE V. Britain. Cymbeline\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten, Lucius and Lords.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThus far, and so farewell.\n\nLUCIUS.\nThanks, royal sir.\nMy emperor hath wrote; I must from hence,\nAnd am right sorry that I must report ye\nMy master\u2019s enemy.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nOur subjects, sir,\nWill not endure his yoke; and for ourself\nTo show less sovereignty than they, must needs\nAppear unkinglike.\n\nLUCIUS.\nSo, sir. I desire of you\nA conduct overland to Milford Haven.\nMadam, all joy befall your Grace, and you!\n\nCYMBELINE.\nMy lords, you are appointed for that office;\nThe due of honour in no point omit.\nSo farewell, noble Lucius.\n\nLUCIUS.\nYour hand, my lord.\n\nCLOTEN.\nReceive it friendly; but from this time forth\nI wear it as your enemy.\n\nLUCIUS.\nSir, the event\nIs yet to name the winner. Fare you well.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nLeave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,\nTill he have cross\u2019d the Severn. Happiness!\n\n [_Exeunt Lucius and Lords._]\n\nQUEEN.\nHe goes hence frowning; but it honours us\nThat we have given him cause.\n\nCLOTEN.\n\u2019Tis all the better;\nYour valiant Britons have their wishes in it.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nLucius hath wrote already to the Emperor\nHow it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely\nOur chariots and our horsemen be in readiness.\nThe pow\u2019rs that he already hath in Gallia\nWill soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves\nHis war for Britain.\n\nQUEEN.\n\u2019Tis not sleepy business,\nBut must be look\u2019d to speedily and strongly.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nOur expectation that it would be thus\nHath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,\nWhere is our daughter? She hath not appear\u2019d\nBefore the Roman, nor to us hath tender\u2019d\nThe duty of the day. She looks us like\nA thing more made of malice than of duty;\nWe have noted it. Call her before us, for\nWe have been too slight in sufferance.\n\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\n\nQUEEN.\nRoyal sir,\nSince the exile of Posthumus, most retir\u2019d\nHath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,\n\u2019Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,\nForbear sharp speeches to her; she\u2019s a lady\nSo tender of rebukes that words are strokes,\nAnd strokes death to her.\n\n Enter Attendant.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWhere is she, sir? How\nCan her contempt be answer\u2019d?\n\nATTENDANT.\nPlease you, sir,\nHer chambers are all lock\u2019d, and there\u2019s no answer\nThat will be given to th\u2019 loud of noise we make.\n\nQUEEN.\nMy lord, when last I went to visit her,\nShe pray\u2019d me to excuse her keeping close;\nWhereto constrain\u2019d by her infirmity\nShe should that duty leave unpaid to you\nWhich daily she was bound to proffer. This\nShe wish\u2019d me to make known; but our great court\nMade me to blame in memory.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHer doors lock\u2019d?\nNot seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear\nProve false!\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nQUEEN.\nSon, I say, follow the King.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThat man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,\nI have not seen these two days.\n\nQUEEN.\nGo, look after.\n\n [_Exit Cloten._]\n\nPisanio, thou that stand\u2019st so for Posthumus!\nHe hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence\nProceed by swallowing that; for he believes\nIt is a thing most precious. But for her,\nWhere is she gone? Haply despair hath seiz\u2019d her;\nOr, wing\u2019d with fervour of her love, she\u2019s flown\nTo her desir\u2019d Posthumus. Gone she is\nTo death or to dishonour, and my end\nCan make good use of either. She being down,\nI have the placing of the British crown.\n\n Enter Cloten.\n\nHow now, my son?\n\nCLOTEN.\n\u2019Tis certain she is fled.\nGo in and cheer the King. He rages; none\nDare come about him.\n\nQUEEN.\nAll the better. May\nThis night forestall him of the coming day!\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nCLOTEN.\nI love and hate her; for she\u2019s fair and royal,\nAnd that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite\nThan lady, ladies, woman. From every one\nThe best she hath, and she, of all compounded,\nOutsells them all. I love her therefore; but\nDisdaining me and throwing favours on\nThe low Posthumus slanders so her judgement\nThat what\u2019s else rare is chok\u2019d; and in that point\nI will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,\nTo be reveng\u2019d upon her. For when fools\nShall\u2014\n\n Enter Pisanio.\n\nWho is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?\nCome hither. Ah, you precious pandar! Villain,\nWhere is thy lady? In a word, or else\nThou art straightway with the fiends.\n\nPISANIO.\nO good my lord!\n\nCLOTEN.\nWhere is thy lady? or, by Jupiter\u2014\nI will not ask again. Close villain,\nI\u2019ll have this secret from thy heart, or rip\nThy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?\nFrom whose so many weights of baseness cannot\nA dram of worth be drawn.\n\nPISANIO.\nAlas, my lord,\nHow can she be with him? When was she miss\u2019d?\nHe is in Rome.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWhere is she, sir? Come nearer.\nNo farther halting! Satisfy me home\nWhat is become of her.\n\nPISANIO.\nO my all-worthy lord!\n\nCLOTEN.\nAll-worthy villain!\nDiscover where thy mistress is at once,\nAt the next word. No more of \u2018worthy lord\u2019!\nSpeak, or thy silence on the instant is\nThy condemnation and thy death.\n\nPISANIO.\nThen, sir,\nThis paper is the history of my knowledge\nTouching her flight.\n\n [_Presenting a letter._]\n\nCLOTEN.\nLet\u2019s see\u2019t. I will pursue her\nEven to Augustus\u2019 throne.\n\nPISANIO.\n[_Aside._] Or this or perish.\nShe\u2019s far enough; and what he learns by this\nMay prove his travel, not her danger.\n\nCLOTEN.\nHumh!\n\nPISANIO.\n[_Aside._] I\u2019ll write to my lord she\u2019s dead. O Imogen,\nSafe mayst thou wander, safe return again!\n\nCLOTEN.\nSirrah, is this letter true?\n\nPISANIO.\nSir, as I think.\n\nCLOTEN.\nIt is Posthumus\u2019 hand; I know\u2019t. Sirrah, if thou wouldst not be a\nvillain, but do me true service, undergo those employments wherein I\nshould have cause to use thee with a serious industry\u2014that is, what\nvillainy soe\u2019er I bid thee do, to perform it directly and truly\u2014I would\nthink thee an honest man; thou shouldst neither want my means for thy\nrelief nor my voice for thy preferment.\n\nPISANIO.\nWell, my good lord.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck\nto the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the\ncourse of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of mine. Wilt thou\nserve me?\n\nPISANIO.\nSir, I will.\n\nCLOTEN.\nGive me thy hand; here\u2019s my purse. Hast any of thy late master\u2019s\ngarments in thy possession?\n\nPISANIO.\nI have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when he took\nleave of my lady and mistress.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThe first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither. Let it be thy\nfirst service; go.\n\nPISANIO.\nI shall, my lord.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nCLOTEN.\nMeet thee at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one thing; I\u2019ll\nremember\u2019t anon. Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee.\nI would these garments were come. She said upon a time\u2014the bitterness\nof it I now belch from my heart\u2014that she held the very garment of\nPosthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person, together\nwith the adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my back will I\nravish her; first kill him, and in her eyes. There shall she see my\nvalour, which will then be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground,\nmy speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath\ndined\u2014which, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that\nshe so prais\u2019d\u2014to the court I\u2019ll knock her back, foot her home again.\nShe hath despis\u2019d me rejoicingly, and I\u2019ll be merry in my revenge.\n\n Enter Pisanio with the clothes.\n\nBe those the garments?\n\nPISANIO.\nAy, my noble lord.\n\nCLOTEN.\nHow long is\u2019t since she went to Milford Haven?\n\nPISANIO.\nShe can scarce be there yet.\n\nCLOTEN.\nBring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing that I have\ncommanded thee. The third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my\ndesign. Be but duteous and true, preferment shall tender itself to\nthee. My revenge is now at Milford, would I had wings to follow it!\nCome, and be true.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPISANIO.\nThou bid\u2019st me to my loss; for true to thee\nWere to prove false, which I will never be,\nTo him that is most true. To Milford go,\nAnd find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,\nYou heavenly blessings, on her! This fool\u2019s speed\nBe cross\u2019d with slowness! Labour be his meed!\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.\n\n Enter Imogen alone, in boy\u2019s clothes.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI see a man\u2019s life is a tedious one.\nI have tir\u2019d myself, and for two nights together\nHave made the ground my bed. I should be sick\nBut that my resolution helps me. Milford,\nWhen from the mountain-top Pisanio show\u2019d thee,\nThou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think\nFoundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,\nWhere they should be reliev\u2019d. Two beggars told me\nI could not miss my way. Will poor folks lie,\nThat have afflictions on them, knowing \u2019tis\nA punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,\nWhen rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness\nIs sorer than to lie for need; and falsehood\nIs worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!\nThou art one o\u2019 th\u2019 false ones. Now I think on thee\nMy hunger\u2019s gone; but even before, I was\nAt point to sink for food. But what is this?\nHere is a path to\u2019t; \u2019tis some savage hold.\nI were best not call; I dare not call. Yet famine,\nEre clean it o\u2019erthrow nature, makes it valiant.\nPlenty and peace breeds cowards; hardness ever\nOf hardiness is mother. Ho! who\u2019s here?\nIf anything that\u2019s civil, speak; if savage,\nTake or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I\u2019ll enter.\nBest draw my sword; and if mine enemy\nBut fear the sword, like me, he\u2019ll scarcely look on\u2019t.\nSuch a foe, good heavens!\n\n [_Exit into the cave._]\n\nSCENE VII. The same.\n\n Enter Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.\n\nBELARIUS.\nYou, Polydore, have prov\u2019d best woodman and\nAre master of the feast. Cadwal and I\nWill play the cook and servant; \u2019tis our match.\nThe sweat of industry would dry and die\nBut for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs\nWill make what\u2019s homely savoury; weariness\nCan snore upon the flint, when resty sloth\nFinds the down pillow hard. Now, peace be here,\nPoor house, that keep\u2019st thyself!\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI am thoroughly weary.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nI am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThere is cold meat i\u2019 th\u2019 cave; we\u2019ll browse on that\nWhilst what we have kill\u2019d be cook\u2019d.\n\nBELARIUS.\n[_Looking into the cave._] Stay, come not in.\nBut that it eats our victuals, I should think\nHere were a fairy.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhat\u2019s the matter, sir?\n\nBELARIUS.\nBy Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,\nAn earthly paragon! Behold divineness\nNo elder than a boy!\n\n Enter Imogen.\n\nIMOGEN.\nGood masters, harm me not.\nBefore I enter\u2019d here I call\u2019d, and thought\nTo have begg\u2019d or bought what I have took. Good troth,\nI have stol\u2019n nought; nor would not though I had found\nGold strew\u2019d i\u2019 th\u2019 floor. Here\u2019s money for my meat.\nI would have left it on the board, so soon\nAs I had made my meal, and parted\nWith pray\u2019rs for the provider.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nMoney, youth?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nAll gold and silver rather turn to dirt,\nAs \u2019tis no better reckon\u2019d but of those\nWho worship dirty gods.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI see you\u2019re angry.\nKnow, if you kill me for my fault, I should\nHave died had I not made it.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWhither bound?\n\nIMOGEN.\nTo Milford Haven.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWhat\u2019s your name?\n\nIMOGEN.\nFidele, sir. I have a kinsman who\nIs bound for Italy; he embark\u2019d at Milford;\nTo whom being going, almost spent with hunger,\nI am fall\u2019n in this offence.\n\nBELARIUS.\nPrithee, fair youth,\nThink us no churls, nor measure our good minds\nBy this rude place we live in. Well encounter\u2019d!\n\u2019Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer\nEre you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it.\nBoys, bid him welcome.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWere you a woman, youth,\nI should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty\nI bid for you as I\u2019d buy.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nI\u2019ll make\u2019t my comfort\nHe is a man. I\u2019ll love him as my brother;\nAnd such a welcome as I\u2019d give to him\nAfter long absence, such is yours. Most welcome!\nBe sprightly, for you fall \u2019mongst friends.\n\nIMOGEN.\n\u2019Mongst friends,\nIf brothers. [_Aside._] Would it had been so that they\nHad been my father\u2019s sons! Then had my prize\nBeen less, and so more equal ballasting\nTo thee, Posthumus.\n\nBELARIUS.\nHe wrings at some distress.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWould I could free\u2019t!\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nOr I, whate\u2019er it be,\nWhat pain it cost, what danger! Gods!\n\nBELARIUS.\n[_Whispering._] Hark, boys.\n\nIMOGEN.\n[_Aside._] Great men,\nThat had a court no bigger than this cave,\nThat did attend themselves, and had the virtue\nWhich their own conscience seal\u2019d them, laying by\nThat nothing-gift of differing multitudes,\nCould not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!\nI\u2019d change my sex to be companion with them,\nSince Leonatus false.\n\nBELARIUS.\nIt shall be so.\nBoys, we\u2019ll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in.\nDiscourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp\u2019d,\nWe\u2019ll mannerly demand thee of thy story,\nSo far as thou wilt speak it.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nPray draw near.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nThe night to th\u2019 owl and morn to th\u2019 lark less\nwelcome.\n\nIMOGEN.\nThanks, sir.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nI pray draw near.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VIII. Rome. A public place.\n\n Enter two Roman Senators and Tribunes.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nThis is the tenour of the Emperor\u2019s writ:\nThat since the common men are now in action\n\u2019Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,\nAnd that the legions now in Gallia are\nFull weak to undertake our wars against\nThe fall\u2019n-off Britons, that we do incite\nThe gentry to this business. He creates\nLucius proconsul; and to you, the tribunes,\nFor this immediate levy, he commands\nHis absolute commission. Long live C\u00e6sar!\n\nTRIBUNE.\nIs Lucius general of the forces?\n\nSECOND SENATOR.\nAy.\n\nTRIBUNE.\nRemaining now in Gallia?\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nWith those legions\nWhich I have spoke of, whereunto your levy\nMust be supplyant. The words of your commission\nWill tie you to the numbers and the time\nOf their dispatch.\n\nTRIBUNE.\nWe will discharge our duty.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\nSCENE I. Wales. Near the cave of Belarius.\n\n Enter Cloten alone.\n\nCLOTEN.\nI am near to th\u2019 place where they should meet, if Pisanio have mapp\u2019d\nit truly. How fit his garments serve me! Why should his mistress, who\nwas made by him that made the tailor, not be fit too? The rather,\nsaving reverence of the word, for \u2019tis said a woman\u2019s fitness comes by\nfits. Therein I must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself, for\nit is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer in his own\nchamber; I mean, the lines of my body are as well drawn as his; no less\nyoung, more strong, not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the\nadvantage of the time, above him in birth, alike conversant in general\nservices, and more remarkable in single oppositions. Yet this\nimperceiverant thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!\nPosthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall\nwithin this hour be off; thy mistress enforced; thy garments cut to\npieces before her face; and all this done, spurn her home to her\nfather, who may, haply, be a little angry for my so rough usage; but my\nmother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my\ncommendations. My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword, and to a sore\npurpose! Fortune, put them into my hand. This is the very description\nof their meeting-place; and the fellow dares not deceive me.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.\n\n Enter from the cave, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus and Imogen.\n\nBELARIUS.\n[_To Imogen._] You are not well. Remain here in the cave;\nWe\u2019ll come to you after hunting.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n[_To Imogen._] Brother, stay here.\nAre we not brothers?\n\nIMOGEN.\nSo man and man should be;\nBut clay and clay differs in dignity,\nWhose dust is both alike. I am very sick.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nGo you to hunting; I\u2019ll abide with him.\n\nIMOGEN.\nSo sick I am not, yet I am not well;\nBut not so citizen a wanton as\nTo seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me;\nStick to your journal course. The breach of custom\nIs breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me\nCannot amend me; society is no comfort\nTo one not sociable. I am not very sick,\nSince I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here.\nI\u2019ll rob none but myself; and let me die,\nStealing so poorly.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI love thee; I have spoke it.\nHow much the quantity, the weight as much\nAs I do love my father.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWhat? how? how?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nIf it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me\nIn my good brother\u2019s fault. I know not why\nI love this youth, and I have heard you say\nLove\u2019s reason\u2019s without reason. The bier at door,\nAnd a demand who is\u2019t shall die, I\u2019d say\n\u2018My father, not this youth.\u2019\n\nBELARIUS.\n[_Aside._] O noble strain!\nO worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!\nCowards father cowards and base things sire base.\nNature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.\nI\u2019m not their father; yet who this should be\nDoth miracle itself, lov\u2019d before me.\u2014\n\u2019Tis the ninth hour o\u2019 th\u2019 morn.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nBrother, farewell.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI wish ye sport.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nYour health. [_To Belarius._] So please you, sir.\n\nIMOGEN.\n[_Aside._] These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I\nhave heard!\nOur courtiers say all\u2019s savage but at court.\nExperience, O, thou disprov\u2019st report!\nTh\u2019 imperious seas breed monsters; for the dish,\nPoor tributary rivers as sweet fish.\nI am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,\nI\u2019ll now taste of thy drug.\n\n [_Swallows some._]\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI could not stir him.\nHe said he was gentle, but unfortunate;\nDishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nThus did he answer me; yet said hereafter\nI might know more.\n\nBELARIUS.\nTo th\u2019 field, to th\u2019 field!\nWe\u2019ll leave you for this time. Go in and rest.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWe\u2019ll not be long away.\n\nBELARIUS.\nPray be not sick,\nFor you must be our huswife.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWell, or ill,\nI am bound to you.\n\nBELARIUS.\nAnd shalt be ever.\n\n [_Exit Imogen into the cave._]\n\nThis youth, howe\u2019er distress\u2019d, appears he hath had\nGood ancestors.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nHow angel-like he sings!\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nBut his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters,\nAnd sauc\u2019d our broths as Juno had been sick,\nAnd he her dieter.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nNobly he yokes\nA smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh\nWas that it was for not being such a smile;\nThe smile mocking the sigh that it would fly\nFrom so divine a temple to commix\nWith winds that sailors rail at.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI do note\nThat grief and patience, rooted in him both,\nMingle their spurs together.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nGrow patience!\nAnd let the stinking elder, grief, untwine\nHis perishing root with the increasing vine!\n\nBELARIUS.\nIt is great morning. Come, away! Who\u2019s there?\n\n Enter Cloten.\n\nCLOTEN.\nI cannot find those runagates; that villain\nHath mock\u2019d me. I am faint.\n\nBELARIUS.\nThose runagates?\nMeans he not us? I partly know him; \u2019tis\nCloten, the son o\u2019 th\u2019 Queen. I fear some ambush.\nI saw him not these many years, and yet\nI know \u2019tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence!\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nHe is but one; you and my brother search\nWhat companies are near. Pray you away;\nLet me alone with him.\n\n [_Exeunt Belarius and Arviragus._]\n\nCLOTEN.\nSoft! What are you\nThat fly me thus? Some villain mountaineers?\nI have heard of such. What slave art thou?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nA thing\nMore slavish did I ne\u2019er than answering\nA slave without a knock.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThou art a robber,\nA law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nTo who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I\nAn arm as big as thine, a heart as big?\nThy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not\nMy dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art;\nWhy I should yield to thee.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThou villain base,\nKnow\u2019st me not by my clothes?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nNo, nor thy tailor, rascal,\nWho is thy grandfather; he made those clothes,\nWhich, as it seems, make thee.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThou precious varlet,\nMy tailor made them not.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nHence, then, and thank\nThe man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;\nI am loath to beat thee.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThou injurious thief,\nHear but my name, and tremble.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhat\u2019s thy name?\n\nCLOTEN.\nCloten, thou villain.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nCloten, thou double villain, be thy name,\nI cannot tremble at it. Were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,\n\u2019Twould move me sooner.\n\nCLOTEN.\nTo thy further fear,\nNay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know\nI am son to th\u2019 Queen.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI\u2019m sorry for\u2019t; not seeming\nSo worthy as thy birth.\n\nCLOTEN.\nArt not afeard?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThose that I reverence, those I fear\u2014the wise;\nAt fools I laugh, not fear them.\n\nCLOTEN.\nDie the death.\nWhen I have slain thee with my proper hand,\nI\u2019ll follow those that even now fled hence,\nAnd on the gates of Lud\u2019s Town set your heads.\nYield, rustic mountaineer.\n\n [_Exeunt, fighting._]\n\n Enter Belarius and Arviragus.\n\nBELARIUS.\nNo company\u2019s abroad?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nNone in the world; you did mistake him, sure.\n\nBELARIUS.\nI cannot tell; long is it since I saw him,\nBut time hath nothing blurr\u2019d those lines of favour\nWhich then he wore; the snatches in his voice,\nAnd burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute\n\u2019Twas very Cloten.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nIn this place we left them.\nI wish my brother make good time with him,\nYou say he is so fell.\n\nBELARIUS.\nBeing scarce made up,\nI mean to man, he had not apprehension\nOr roaring terrors; for defect of judgement\nIs oft the cease of fear.\n\n Enter Guiderius with Cloten\u2019s head.\n\nBut, see, thy brother.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThis Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;\nThere was no money in\u2019t. Not Hercules\nCould have knock\u2019d out his brains, for he had none;\nYet I not doing this, the fool had borne\nMy head as I do his.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWhat hast thou done?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI am perfect what: cut off one Cloten\u2019s head,\nSon to the Queen, after his own report;\nWho call\u2019d me traitor, mountaineer, and swore\nWith his own single hand he\u2019d take us in,\nDisplace our heads where, thank the gods, they grow,\nAnd set them on Lud\u2019s Town.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWe are all undone.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhy, worthy father, what have we to lose\nBut that he swore to take, our lives? The law\nProtects not us; then why should we be tender\nTo let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,\nPlay judge and executioner all himself,\nFor we do fear the law? What company\nDiscover you abroad?\n\nBELARIUS.\nNo single soul\nCan we set eye on, but in all safe reason\nHe must have some attendants. Though his humour\nWas nothing but mutation, ay, and that\nFrom one bad thing to worse, not frenzy, not\nAbsolute madness could so far have rav\u2019d,\nTo bring him here alone. Although perhaps\nIt may be heard at court that such as we\nCave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time\nMay make some stronger head, the which he hearing,\nAs it is like him, might break out and swear\nHe\u2019d fetch us in; yet is\u2019t not probable\nTo come alone, either he so undertaking\nOr they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear,\nIf we do fear this body hath a tail\nMore perilous than the head.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nLet ordinance\nCome as the gods foresay it. Howsoe\u2019er,\nMy brother hath done well.\n\nBELARIUS.\nI had no mind\nTo hunt this day; the boy Fidele\u2019s sickness\nDid make my way long forth.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWith his own sword,\nWhich he did wave against my throat, I have ta\u2019en\nHis head from him. I\u2019ll throw\u2019t into the creek\nBehind our rock, and let it to the sea\nAnd tell the fishes he\u2019s the Queen\u2019s son, Cloten.\nThat\u2019s all I reck.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nBELARIUS.\nI fear \u2019twill be reveng\u2019d.\nWould, Polydore, thou hadst not done\u2019t! though valour\nBecomes thee well enough.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWould I had done\u2019t,\nSo the revenge alone pursu\u2019d me! Polydore,\nI love thee brotherly, but envy much\nThou hast robb\u2019d me of this deed. I would revenges,\nThat possible strength might meet, would seek us through,\nAnd put us to our answer.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWell, \u2019tis done.\nWe\u2019ll hunt no more today, nor seek for danger\nWhere there\u2019s no profit. I prithee to our rock.\nYou and Fidele play the cooks; I\u2019ll stay\nTill hasty Polydore return, and bring him\nTo dinner presently.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nPoor sick Fidele!\nI\u2019ll willingly to him; to gain his colour\nI\u2019d let a parish of such Cloten\u2019s blood,\nAnd praise myself for charity.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nBELARIUS.\nO thou goddess,\nThou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon\u2019st\nIn these two princely boys! They are as gentle\nAs zephyrs blowing below the violet,\nNot wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,\nTheir royal blood enchaf\u2019d, as the rud\u2019st wind\nThat by the top doth take the mountain pine\nAnd make him stoop to th\u2019 vale. \u2019Tis wonder\nThat an invisible instinct should frame them\nTo royalty unlearn\u2019d, honour untaught,\nCivility not seen from other, valour\nThat wildly grows in them, but yields a crop\nAs if it had been sow\u2019d. Yet still it\u2019s strange\nWhat Cloten\u2019s being here to us portends,\nOr what his death will bring us.\n\n Enter Guiderius.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhere\u2019s my brother?\nI have sent Cloten\u2019s clotpoll down the stream,\nIn embassy to his mother; his body\u2019s hostage\nFor his return.\n\n [_Solemn music._]\n\nBELARIUS.\nMy ingenious instrument!\nHark, Polydore, it sounds. But what occasion\nHath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nIs he at home?\n\nBELARIUS.\nHe went hence even now.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhat does he mean? Since death of my dear\u2019st mother\nIt did not speak before. All solemn things\nShould answer solemn accidents. The matter?\nTriumphs for nothing and lamenting toys\nIs jollity for apes and grief for boys.\nIs Cadwal mad?\n\n Enter Arviragus with Imogen as dead, bearing her in his arms.\n\nBELARIUS.\nLook, here he comes,\nAnd brings the dire occasion in his arms\nOf what we blame him for!\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nThe bird is dead\nThat we have made so much on. I had rather\nHave skipp\u2019d from sixteen years of age to sixty,\nTo have turn\u2019d my leaping time into a crutch,\nThan have seen this.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nO sweetest, fairest lily!\nMy brother wears thee not the one half so well\nAs when thou grew\u2019st thyself.\n\nBELARIUS.\nO melancholy!\nWho ever yet could sound thy bottom? find\nThe ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare\nMight\u2019st easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!\nJove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,\nThou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.\nHow found you him?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nStark, as you see;\nThus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,\nNot as death\u2019s dart, being laugh\u2019d at; his right cheek\nReposing on a cushion.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhere?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nO\u2019 th\u2019 floor;\nHis arms thus leagu\u2019d. I thought he slept, and put\nMy clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness\nAnswer\u2019d my steps too loud.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhy, he but sleeps.\nIf he be gone he\u2019ll make his grave a bed;\nWith female fairies will his tomb be haunted,\nAnd worms will not come to thee.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWith fairest flowers,\nWhilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,\nI\u2019ll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack\nThe flower that\u2019s like thy face, pale primrose; nor\nThe azur\u2019d hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor\nThe leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,\nOut-sweet\u2019ned not thy breath. The ruddock would,\nWith charitable bill (O bill, sore shaming\nThose rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie\nWithout a monument!) bring thee all this;\nYea, and furr\u2019d moss besides, when flow\u2019rs are none,\nTo winter-ground thy corse\u2014\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nPrithee have done,\nAnd do not play in wench-like words with that\nWhich is so serious. Let us bury him,\nAnd not protract with admiration what\nIs now due debt. To th\u2019 grave.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nSay, where shall\u2019s lay him?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nBy good Euriphile, our mother.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nBe\u2019t so;\nAnd let us, Polydore, though now our voices\nHave got the mannish crack, sing him to th\u2019 ground,\nAs once to our mother; use like note and words,\nSave that Euriphile must be Fidele.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nCadwal,\nI cannot sing. I\u2019ll weep, and word it with thee;\nFor notes of sorrow out of tune are worse\nThan priests and fanes that lie.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWe\u2019ll speak it, then.\n\nBELARIUS.\nGreat griefs, I see, med\u2019cine the less, for Cloten\nIs quite forgot. He was a queen\u2019s son, boys;\nAnd though he came our enemy, remember\nHe was paid for that. Though mean and mighty rotting\nTogether have one dust, yet reverence,\nThat angel of the world, doth make distinction\nOf place \u2019tween high and low. Our foe was princely;\nAnd though you took his life, as being our foe,\nYet bury him as a prince.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nPray you fetch him hither.\nThersites\u2019 body is as good as Ajax\u2019,\nWhen neither are alive.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nIf you\u2019ll go fetch him,\nWe\u2019ll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.\n\n [_Exit Belarius._]\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nNay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th\u2019 East;\nMy father hath a reason for\u2019t.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n\u2019Tis true.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nCome on, then, and remove him.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nSo. Begin.\n\nSONG\n\nGUIDERIUS.\n_    Fear no more the heat o\u2019 th\u2019 sun,\n        Nor the furious winter\u2019s rages;\n    Thou thy worldly task hast done,\n        Home art gone, and ta\u2019en thy wages.\n    Golden lads and girls all must,\n    As chimney-sweepers, come to dust._\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n_    Fear no more the frown o\u2019 th\u2019 great;\n        Thou art past the tyrant\u2019s stroke.\n    Care no more to clothe and eat;\n        To thee the reed is as the oak.\n    The sceptre, learning, physic, must\n    All follow this and come to dust._\n\nGUIDERIUS.\n_    Fear no more the lightning flash._\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n_        Nor th\u2019 all-dreaded thunder-stone._\n\nGUIDERIUS.\n_    Fear not slander, censure rash;_\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n_    Thou hast finish\u2019d joy and moan._\n\nBOTH.\n_    All lovers young, all lovers must\n    Consign to thee and come to dust._\n\nGUIDERIUS.\n_    No exorciser harm thee!_\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n_    Nor no witchcraft charm thee!_\n\nGUIDERIUS.\n_    Ghost unlaid forbear thee!_\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n_    Nothing ill come near thee!_\n\nBOTH.\n_    Quiet consummation have,\n    And renowned be thy grave!_\n\n Enter Belarius with the body of Cloten.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWe have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.\n\nBELARIUS.\nHere\u2019s a few flowers; but \u2019bout midnight, more.\nThe herbs that have on them cold dew o\u2019 th\u2019 night\nAre strewings fit\u2019st for graves. Upon their faces.\nYou were as flow\u2019rs, now wither\u2019d. Even so\nThese herblets shall which we upon you strew.\nCome on, away. Apart upon our knees.\nThe ground that gave them first has them again.\nTheir pleasures here are past, so is their pain.\n\n [_Exeunt all but Imogen._]\n\nIMOGEN.\n[_Awaking._] Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way?\nI thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither?\n\u2019Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?\nI have gone all night. Faith, I\u2019ll lie down and sleep.\nBut, soft! no bedfellow. O gods and goddesses!\n\n [_Seeing the body._]\n\nThese flow\u2019rs are like the pleasures of the world;\nThis bloody man, the care on\u2019t. I hope I dream;\nFor so I thought I was a cave-keeper,\nAnd cook to honest creatures. But \u2019tis not so;\n\u2019Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,\nWhich the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes\nAre sometimes, like our judgements, blind. Good faith,\nI tremble still with fear; but if there be\nYet left in heaven as small a drop of pity\nAs a wren\u2019s eye, fear\u2019d gods, a part of it!\nThe dream\u2019s here still. Even when I wake it is\nWithout me, as within me; not imagin\u2019d, felt.\nA headless man? The garments of Posthumus?\nI know the shape of\u2019s leg; this is his hand,\nHis foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh,\nThe brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face\u2014\nMurder in heaven! How! \u2019Tis gone. Pisanio,\nAll curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,\nAnd mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,\nConspir\u2019d with that irregulous devil, Cloten,\nHath here cut off my lord. To write and read\nBe henceforth treacherous! Damn\u2019d Pisanio\nHath with his forged letters (damn\u2019d Pisanio)\nFrom this most bravest vessel of the world\nStruck the main-top. O Posthumus! alas,\nWhere is thy head? Where\u2019s that? Ay me! where\u2019s that?\nPisanio might have kill\u2019d thee at the heart,\nAnd left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?\n\u2019Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them\nHave laid this woe here. O, \u2019tis pregnant, pregnant!\nThe drug he gave me, which he said was precious\nAnd cordial to me, have I not found it\nMurd\u2019rous to th\u2019 senses? That confirms it home.\nThis is Pisanio\u2019s deed, and Cloten. O!\nGive colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,\nThat we the horrider may seem to those\nWhich chance to find us. O, my lord, my lord!\n\n [_Falls fainting on the body._]\n\n Enter Lucius, Captains and a Soothsayer.\n\nCAPTAIN.\nTo them the legions garrison\u2019d in Gallia,\nAfter your will, have cross\u2019d the sea, attending\nYou here at Milford Haven; with your ships,\nThey are in readiness.\n\nLUCIUS.\nBut what from Rome?\n\nCAPTAIN.\nThe Senate hath stirr\u2019d up the confiners\nAnd gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,\nThat promise noble service; and they come\nUnder the conduct of bold Iachimo,\nSienna\u2019s brother.\n\nLUCIUS.\nWhen expect you them?\n\nCAPTAIN.\nWith the next benefit o\u2019 th\u2019 wind.\n\nLUCIUS.\nThis forwardness\nMakes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers\nBe muster\u2019d; bid the captains look to\u2019t. Now, sir,\nWhat have you dream\u2019d of late of this war\u2019s purpose?\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nLast night the very gods show\u2019d me a vision\n(I fast and pray\u2019d for their intelligence) thus:\nI saw Jove\u2019s bird, the Roman eagle, wing\u2019d\nFrom the spongy south to this part of the west,\nThere vanish\u2019d in the sunbeams; which portends,\nUnless my sins abuse my divination,\nSuccess to th\u2019 Roman host.\n\nLUCIUS.\nDream often so,\nAnd never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here\nWithout his top? The ruin speaks that sometime\nIt was a worthy building. How? a page?\nOr dead or sleeping on him? But dead, rather;\nFor nature doth abhor to make his bed\nWith the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.\nLet\u2019s see the boy\u2019s face.\n\nCAPTAIN.\nHe\u2019s alive, my lord.\n\nLUCIUS.\nHe\u2019ll then instruct us of this body. Young one,\nInform us of thy fortunes; for it seems\nThey crave to be demanded. Who is this\nThou mak\u2019st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he\nThat, otherwise than noble nature did,\nHath alter\u2019d that good picture? What\u2019s thy interest\nIn this sad wreck? How came\u2019t? Who is\u2019t?\nWhat art thou?\n\nIMOGEN.\nI am nothing; or if not,\nNothing to be were better. This was my master,\nA very valiant Briton and a good,\nThat here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!\nThere is no more such masters. I may wander\nFrom east to occident; cry out for service;\nTry many, all good; serve truly; never\nFind such another master.\n\nLUCIUS.\n\u2019Lack, good youth!\nThou mov\u2019st no less with thy complaining than\nThy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.\n\nIMOGEN.\nRichard du Champ. [_Aside._] If I do lie, and do\nNo harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope\nThey\u2019ll pardon it.\u2014Say you, sir?\n\nLUCIUS.\nThy name?\n\nIMOGEN.\nFidele, sir.\n\nLUCIUS.\nThou dost approve thyself the very same;\nThy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.\nWilt take thy chance with me? I will not say\nThou shalt be so well master\u2019d; but, be sure,\nNo less belov\u2019d. The Roman Emperor\u2019s letters,\nSent by a consul to me, should not sooner\nThan thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI\u2019ll follow, sir. But first, an\u2019t please the gods,\nI\u2019ll hide my master from the flies, as deep\nAs these poor pickaxes can dig; and when\nWith wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha\u2019 strew\u2019d his grave,\nAnd on it said a century of prayers,\nSuch as I can, twice o\u2019er, I\u2019ll weep and sigh;\nAnd leaving so his service, follow you,\nSo please you entertain me.\n\nLUCIUS.\nAy, good youth;\nAnd rather father thee than master thee.\nMy friends,\nThe boy hath taught us manly duties; let us\nFind out the prettiest daisied plot we can,\nAnd make him with our pikes and partisans\nA grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr\u2019d\nBy thee to us; and he shall be interr\u2019d\nAs soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes.\nSome falls are means the happier to arise.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Britain. Cymbeline\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Cymbeline, Lords, Pisanio and Attendants.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nAgain! and bring me word how \u2019tis with her.\n\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\n\nA fever with the absence of her son;\nA madness, of which her life\u2019s in danger. Heavens,\nHow deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,\nThe great part of my comfort, gone; my queen\nUpon a desperate bed, and in a time\nWhen fearful wars point at me; her son gone,\nSo needful for this present. It strikes me past\nThe hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,\nWho needs must know of her departure and\nDost seem so ignorant, we\u2019ll enforce it from thee\nBy a sharp torture.\n\nPISANIO.\nSir, my life is yours;\nI humbly set it at your will; but for my mistress,\nI nothing know where she remains, why gone,\nNor when she purposes return. Beseech your Highness,\nHold me your loyal servant.\n\nLORD.\nGood my liege,\nThe day that she was missing he was here.\nI dare be bound he\u2019s true and shall perform\nAll parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,\nThere wants no diligence in seeking him,\nAnd will no doubt be found.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThe time is troublesome.\n[_To Pisanio._] We\u2019ll slip you for a season; but our jealousy\nDoes yet depend.\n\nLORD.\nSo please your Majesty,\nThe Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,\nAre landed on your coast, with a supply\nOf Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nNow for the counsel of my son and queen!\nI am amaz\u2019d with matter.\n\nLORD.\nGood my liege,\nYour preparation can affront no less\nThan what you hear of. Come more, for more you\u2019re ready.\nThe want is but to put those pow\u2019rs in motion\nThat long to move.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nI thank you. Let\u2019s withdraw,\nAnd meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not\nWhat can from Italy annoy us; but\nWe grieve at chances here. Away!\n\n [_Exeunt all but Pisanio._]\n\nPISANIO.\nI heard no letter from my master since\nI wrote him Imogen was slain. \u2019Tis strange.\nNor hear I from my mistress, who did promise\nTo yield me often tidings. Neither know I\nWhat is betid to Cloten, but remain\nPerplex\u2019d in all. The heavens still must work.\nWherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.\nThese present wars shall find I love my country,\nEven to the note o\u2019 th\u2019 King, or I\u2019ll fall in them.\nAll other doubts, by time let them be clear\u2019d:\nFortune brings in some boats that are not steer\u2019d.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE IV. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.\n\n Enter Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThe noise is round about us.\n\nBELARIUS.\nLet us from it.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWhat pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it\nFrom action and adventure?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nNay, what hope\nHave we in hiding us? This way the Romans\nMust or for Britons slay us, or receive us\nFor barbarous and unnatural revolts\nDuring their use, and slay us after.\n\nBELARIUS.\nSons,\nWe\u2019ll higher to the mountains; there secure us.\nTo the King\u2019s party there\u2019s no going. Newness\nOf Cloten\u2019s death (we being not known, not muster\u2019d\nAmong the bands) may drive us to a render\nWhere we have liv\u2019d, and so extort from\u2019s that\nWhich we have done, whose answer would be death,\nDrawn on with torture.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThis is, sir, a doubt\nIn such a time nothing becoming you\nNor satisfying us.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nIt is not likely\nThat when they hear the Roman horses neigh,\nBehold their quarter\u2019d fires, have both their eyes\nAnd ears so cloy\u2019d importantly as now,\nThat they will waste their time upon our note,\nTo know from whence we are.\n\nBELARIUS.\nO, I am known\nOf many in the army. Many years,\nThough Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him\nFrom my remembrance. And, besides, the King\nHath not deserv\u2019d my service nor your loves,\nWho find in my exile the want of breeding,\nThe certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless\nTo have the courtesy your cradle promis\u2019d,\nBut to be still hot summer\u2019s tanlings and\nThe shrinking slaves of winter.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThan be so,\nBetter to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th\u2019 army.\nI and my brother are not known; yourself\nSo out of thought, and thereto so o\u2019ergrown,\nCannot be questioned.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nBy this sun that shines,\nI\u2019ll thither. What thing is\u2019t that I never\nDid see man die! scarce ever look\u2019d on blood\nBut that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!\nNever bestrid a horse, save one that had\nA rider like myself, who ne\u2019er wore rowel\nNor iron on his heel! I am asham\u2019d\nTo look upon the holy sun, to have\nThe benefit of his blest beams, remaining\nSo long a poor unknown.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nBy heavens, I\u2019ll go!\nIf you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,\nI\u2019ll take the better care; but if you will not,\nThe hazard therefore due fall on me by\nThe hands of Romans!\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nSo say I. Amen.\n\nBELARIUS.\nNo reason I, since of your lives you set\nSo slight a valuation, should reserve\nMy crack\u2019d one to more care. Have with you, boys!\nIf in your country wars you chance to die,\nThat is my bed too, lads, and there I\u2019ll lie.\nLead, lead. [_Aside._] The time seems long; their blood thinks scorn\nTill it fly out and show them princes born.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT V\n\nSCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.\n\n Enter Posthumus alone, with a bloody handkerchief.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYea, bloody cloth, I\u2019ll keep thee; for I wish\u2019d\nThou shouldst be colour\u2019d thus. You married ones,\nIf each of you should take this course, how many\nMust murder wives much better than themselves\nFor wrying but a little! O Pisanio!\nEvery good servant does not all commands;\nNo bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you\nShould have ta\u2019en vengeance on my faults, I never\nHad liv\u2019d to put on this; so had you saved\nThe noble Imogen to repent, and struck\nMe, wretch more worth your vengeance. But alack,\nYou snatch some hence for little faults; that\u2019s love,\nTo have them fall no more. You some permit\nTo second ills with ills, each elder worse,\nAnd make them dread it, to the doers\u2019 thrift.\nBut Imogen is your own. Do your best wills,\nAnd make me blest to obey. I am brought hither\nAmong th\u2019 Italian gentry, and to fight\nAgainst my lady\u2019s kingdom. \u2019Tis enough\nThat, Britain, I have kill\u2019d thy mistress; peace!\nI\u2019ll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,\nHear patiently my purpose. I\u2019ll disrobe me\nOf these Italian weeds, and suit myself\nAs does a Britain peasant. So I\u2019ll fight\nAgainst the part I come with; so I\u2019ll die\nFor thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life\nIs every breath a death. And thus unknown,\nPitied nor hated, to the face of peril\nMyself I\u2019ll dedicate. Let me make men know\nMore valour in me than my habits show.\nGods, put the strength o\u2019 th\u2019 Leonati in me!\nTo shame the guise o\u2019 th\u2019 world, I will begin\nThe fashion less without and more within.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II. Britain. A field of battle between the British and Roman\ncamps.\n\n Enter Lucius, Iachimo and the Roman army at one door, and the British\n army at another, Leonatus Posthumus following like a poor soldier.\n They march over and go out. Alarums. Then enter again, in skirmish,\n Iachimo and Posthumus. He vanquisheth and disarmeth Iachimo and then\n leaves him.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThe heaviness and guilt within my bosom\nTakes off my manhood. I have belied a lady,\nThe Princess of this country, and the air on\u2019t\nRevengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,\nA very drudge of nature\u2019s, have subdu\u2019d me\nIn my profession? Knighthoods and honours borne\nAs I wear mine are titles but of scorn.\nIf that thy gentry, Britain, go before\nThis lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds\nIs that we scarce are men, and you are gods.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n The battle continues; the Britons fly; Cymbeline is taken. Then enter\n to his rescue Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.\n\nBELARIUS.\nStand, stand! We have th\u2019 advantage of the ground;\nThe lane is guarded; nothing routs us but\nThe villainy of our fears.\n\nGUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS.\nStand, stand, and fight!\n\n Enter Posthumus and seconds the Britons; they rescue Cymbeline and\n exeunt. Then re-enter Lucius and Iachimo with Imogen.\n\nLUCIUS.\nAway, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;\nFor friends kill friends, and the disorder\u2019s such\nAs war were hoodwink\u2019d.\n\nIACHIMO.\n\u2019Tis their fresh supplies.\n\nLUCIUS.\nIt is a day turn\u2019d strangely. Or betimes\nLet\u2019s reinforce or fly.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Another part of the field.\n\n Enter Posthumus and a Briton Lord.\n\nLORD.\nCam\u2019st thou from where they made the stand?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI did:\nThough you, it seems, come from the fliers.\n\nLORD.\nI did.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nNo blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,\nBut that the heavens fought. The King himself\nOf his wings destitute, the army broken,\nAnd but the backs of Britons seen, all flying,\nThrough a strait lane; the enemy, full-hearted,\nLolling the tongue with slaught\u2019ring, having work\nMore plentiful than tools to do\u2019t, struck down\nSome mortally, some slightly touch\u2019d, some falling\nMerely through fear, that the strait pass was damm\u2019d\nWith dead men hurt behind, and cowards living\nTo die with length\u2019ned shame.\n\nLORD.\nWhere was this lane?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nClose by the battle, ditch\u2019d, and wall\u2019d with turf,\nWhich gave advantage to an ancient soldier,\nAn honest one, I warrant, who deserv\u2019d\nSo long a breeding as his white beard came to,\nIn doing this for\u2019s country. Athwart the lane\nHe, with two striplings (lads more like to run\nThe country base than to commit such slaughter;\nWith faces fit for masks, or rather fairer\nThan those for preservation cas\u2019d or shame)\nMade good the passage, cried to those that fled\n\u2018Our Britain\u2019s harts die flying, not our men.\nTo darkness fleet souls that fly backwards! Stand;\nOr we are Romans and will give you that,\nLike beasts, which you shun beastly, and may save\nBut to look back in frown. Stand, stand!\u2019 These three,\nThree thousand confident, in act as many\u2014\nFor three performers are the file when all\nThe rest do nothing\u2014with this word \u2018Stand, stand!\u2019\nAccommodated by the place, more charming\nWith their own nobleness, which could have turn\u2019d\nA distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,\nPart shame, part spirit renew\u2019d; that some turn\u2019d coward\nBut by example (O, a sin in war\nDamn\u2019d in the first beginners) \u2019gan to look\nThe way that they did and to grin like lions\nUpon the pikes o\u2019 th\u2019 hunters. Then began\nA stop i\u2019 th\u2019 chaser, a retire; anon\nA rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,\nChickens, the way which they stoop\u2019d eagles; slaves,\nThe strides they victors made; and now our cowards,\nLike fragments in hard voyages, became\nThe life o\u2019 th\u2019 need. Having found the back-door open\nOf the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!\nSome slain before, some dying, some their friends\nO\u2019erborne i\u2019 th\u2019 former wave. Ten chas\u2019d by one\nAre now each one the slaughterman of twenty.\nThose that would die or ere resist are grown\nThe mortal bugs o\u2019 th\u2019 field.\n\nLORD.\nThis was strange chance:\nA narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nNay, do not wonder at it; you are made\nRather to wonder at the things you hear\nThan to work any. Will you rhyme upon\u2019t,\nAnd vent it for a mock\u2019ry? Here is one:\n\n\n        \u2018Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,\n        Preserv\u2019d the Britons, was the Romans\u2019 bane.\u2019\n\nLORD.\nNay, be not angry, sir.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\n\u2019Lack, to what end?\nWho dares not stand his foe I\u2019ll be his friend;\nFor if he\u2019ll do as he is made to do,\nI know he\u2019ll quickly fly my friendship too.\nYou have put me into rhyme.\n\nLORD.\nFarewell; you\u2019re angry.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nStill going? This is a lord! O noble misery,\nTo be i\u2019 th\u2019 field and ask \u2018What news?\u2019 of me!\nToday how many would have given their honours\nTo have sav\u2019d their carcasses! took heel to do\u2019t,\nAnd yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm\u2019d,\nCould not find death where I did hear him groan,\nNor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly monster,\n\u2019Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,\nSweet words; or hath moe ministers than we\nThat draw his knives i\u2019 th\u2019 war. Well, I will find him;\nFor being now a favourer to the Briton,\nNo more a Briton, I have resum\u2019d again\nThe part I came in. Fight I will no more,\nBut yield me to the veriest hind that shall\nOnce touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is\nHere made by th\u2019 Roman; great the answer be\nBritons must take. For me, my ransom\u2019s death;\nOn either side I come to spend my breath,\nWhich neither here I\u2019ll keep nor bear again,\nBut end it by some means for Imogen.\n\n Enter two British Captains and soldiers.\n\nFIRST CAPTAIN.\nGreat Jupiter be prais\u2019d! Lucius is taken.\n\u2019Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.\n\nSECOND CAPTAIN.\nThere was a fourth man, in a silly habit,\nThat gave th\u2019 affront with them.\n\nFIRST CAPTAIN.\nSo \u2019tis reported;\nBut none of \u2019em can be found. Stand! who\u2019s there?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nA Roman,\nWho had not now been drooping here if seconds\nHad answer\u2019d him.\n\nSECOND CAPTAIN.\nLay hands on him; a dog!\nA leg of Rome shall not return to tell\nWhat crows have peck\u2019d them here. He brags his service,\nAs if he were of note. Bring him to th\u2019 King.\n\n Enter Cymbeline, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, Pisanio and Roman\n captives. The Captains present Posthumus to Cymbeline, who delivers\n him over to a gaoler.\n\n [_Exeunt omnes._]\n\nSCENE IV. Britain. A prison.\n\n Enter Posthumus and two Gaolers.\n\nFIRST GAOLER. You shall not now be stol\u2019n, you have locks upon you;\nSo graze as you find pasture.\n\nSECOND GAOLER.\nAy, or a stomach.\n\n [_Exeunt Gaolers._]\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nMost welcome, bondage! for thou art a way,\nI think, to liberty. Yet am I better\nThan one that\u2019s sick o\u2019 th\u2019 gout, since he had rather\nGroan so in perpetuity than be cur\u2019d\nBy th\u2019 sure physician death, who is the key\nT\u2019 unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter\u2019d\nMore than my shanks and wrists; you good gods, give me\nThe penitent instrument to pick that bolt,\nThen, free for ever! Is\u2019t enough I am sorry?\nSo children temporal fathers do appease;\nGods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,\nI cannot do it better than in gyves,\nDesir\u2019d more than constrain\u2019d. To satisfy,\nIf of my freedom \u2019tis the main part, take\nNo stricter render of me than my all.\nI know you are more clement than vile men,\nWho of their broken debtors take a third,\nA sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again\nOn their abatement; that\u2019s not my desire.\nFor Imogen\u2019s dear life take mine; and though\n\u2019Tis not so dear, yet \u2019tis a life; you coin\u2019d it.\n\u2019Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;\nThough light, take pieces for the figure\u2019s sake;\nYou rather mine, being yours.

But the comfort is, you shall be called\nto no more payments, fear no more tavern bills, which are often the\nsadness of parting, as the procuring of mirth. You come in faint for\nwant of meat, depart reeling with too much drink; sorry that you have\npaid too much, and sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain\nboth empty; the brain the heavier for being too light, the purse too\nlight, being drawn of heaviness. O, of this contradiction you shall now\nbe quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a\ntrice. You have no true debitor and creditor but it; of what\u2019s past,\nis, and to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and\ncounters; so the acquittance follows.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI am merrier to die than thou art to live.\n\nGAOLER.\nIndeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the toothache. But a man that\nwere to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he\nwould change places with his officer; for look you, sir, you know not\nwhich way you shall go.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYes indeed do I, fellow.\n\nGAOLER.\nYour death has eyes in\u2019s head, then; I have not seen him so pictur\u2019d.\nYou must either be directed by some that take upon them to know, or to\ntake upon yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or jump the\nafter-inquiry on your own peril. And how you shall speed in your\njourney\u2019s end, I think you\u2019ll never return to tell one.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct them the way I\nam going, but such as wink and will not use them.\n\nGAOLER.\nWhat an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the best use of\neyes to see the way of blindness!

Why so sadly\nGreet you our victory? You look like Romans,\nAnd not o\u2019 th\u2019 court of Britain.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nHail, great King!\nTo sour your happiness I must report\nThe Queen is dead.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWho worse than a physician\nWould this report become? But I consider\nBy med\u2019cine life may be prolong\u2019d, yet death\nWill seize the doctor too. How ended she?\n\nCORNELIUS.\nWith horror, madly dying, like her life;\nWhich, being cruel to the world, concluded\nMost cruel to herself. What she confess\u2019d\nI will report, so please you; these her women\nCan trip me if I err, who with wet cheeks\nWere present when she finish\u2019d.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nPrithee say.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nFirst, she confess\u2019d she never lov\u2019d you; only\nAffected greatness got by you, not you;\nMarried your royalty, was wife to your place;\nAbhorr\u2019d your person.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nShe alone knew this;\nAnd but she spoke it dying, I would not\nBelieve her lips in opening it. Proceed.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nYour daughter, whom she bore in hand to love\nWith such integrity, she did confess\nWas as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,\nBut that her flight prevented it, she had\nTa\u2019en off by poison.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nO most delicate fiend!\nWho is\u2019t can read a woman? Is there more?\n\nCORNELIUS.\nMore, sir, and worse. She did confess she had\nFor you a mortal mineral, which, being took,\nShould by the minute feed on life, and ling\u2019ring,\nBy inches waste you. In which time she purpos\u2019d,\nBy watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to\nO\u2019ercome you with her show; and in time,\nWhen she had fitted you with her craft, to work\nHer son into th\u2019 adoption of the crown;\nBut failing of her end by his strange absence,\nGrew shameless-desperate, open\u2019d, in despite\nOf heaven and men, her purposes, repented\nThe evils she hatch\u2019d were not effected; so,\nDespairing, died.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHeard you all this, her women?\n\nLADIES.\nWe did, so please your Highness.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nMine eyes\nWere not in fault, for she was beautiful;\nMine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart\nThat thought her like her seeming. It had been vicious\nTo have mistrusted her; yet, O my daughter!\nThat it was folly in me thou mayst say,\nAnd prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!\n\n Enter Lucius, Iachimo, the Soothsayer and other Roman prisoners,\n guarded; Posthumus behind, and Imogen.\n\nThou com\u2019st not, Caius, now for tribute; that\nThe Britons have raz\u2019d out, though with the loss\nOf many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit\nThat their good souls may be appeas\u2019d with slaughter\nOf you their captives, which ourself have granted;\nSo think of your estate.\n\nLUCIUS.\nConsider, sir, the chance of war. The day\nWas yours by accident; had it gone with us,\nWe should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten\u2019d\nOur prisoners with the sword. But since the gods\nWill have it thus, that nothing but our lives\nMay be call\u2019d ransom, let it come. Sufficeth\nA Roman with a Roman\u2019s heart can suffer.\nAugustus lives to think on\u2019t; and so much\nFor my peculiar care. This one thing only\nI will entreat: my boy, a Briton born,\nLet him be ransom\u2019d. Never master had\nA page so kind, so duteous, diligent,\nSo tender over his occasions, true,\nSo feat, so nurse-like; let his virtue join\nWith my request, which I\u2019ll make bold your Highness\nCannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm\nThough he have serv\u2019d a Roman. Save him, sir,\nAnd spare no blood beside.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nI have surely seen him;\nHis favour is familiar to me. Boy,\nThou hast look\u2019d thyself into my grace,\nAnd art mine own. I know not why, wherefore\nTo say \u201cLive, boy.\u201d Ne\u2019er thank thy master. Live;\nAnd ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,\nFitting my bounty and thy state, I\u2019ll give it;\nYea, though thou do demand a prisoner,\nThe noblest ta\u2019en.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI humbly thank your Highness.\n\nLUCIUS.\nI do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,\nAnd yet I know thou wilt.\n\nIMOGEN.\nNo, no! Alack,\nThere\u2019s other work in hand. I see a thing\nBitter to me as death; your life, good master,\nMust shuffle for itself.\n\nLUCIUS.\nThe boy disdains me,\nHe leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys\nThat place them on the truth of girls and boys.\nWhy stands he so perplex\u2019d?\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWhat wouldst thou, boy?\nI love thee more and more; think more and more\nWhat\u2019s best to ask. Know\u2019st him thou look\u2019st on? Speak,\nWilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?\n\nIMOGEN.\nHe is a Roman, no more kin to me\nThan I to your Highness; who, being born your vassal,\nAm something nearer.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWherefore ey\u2019st him so?\n\nIMOGEN.\nI\u2019ll tell you, sir, in private, if you please\nTo give me hearing.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nAy, with all my heart,\nAnd lend my best attention. What\u2019s thy name?\n\nIMOGEN.\nFidele, sir.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThou\u2019rt my good youth, my page;\nI\u2019ll be thy master. Walk with me; speak freely.\n\n [_Cymbeline and Imogen converse apart._]\n\nBELARIUS.\nIs not this boy reviv\u2019d from death?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nOne sand another\nNot more resembles that sweet rosy lad\nWho died and was Fidele. What think you?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThe same dead thing alive.\n\nBELARIUS.\nPeace, peace! see further. He eyes us not; forbear.\nCreatures may be alike; were\u2019t he, I am sure\nHe would have spoke to us.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nBut we see him dead.\n\nBELARIUS.\nBe silent; let\u2019s see further.\n\nPISANIO.\n[_Aside._] It is my mistress.\nSince she is living, let the time run on\nTo good or bad.\n\n [_Cymbeline and Imogen advance._]\n\nCYMBELINE.\nCome, stand thou by our side;\nMake thy demand aloud. [_To Iachimo._] Sir, step you forth;\nGive answer to this boy, and do it freely,\nOr, by our greatness and the grace of it,\nWhich is our honour, bitter torture shall\nWinnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.\n\nIMOGEN.\nMy boon is that this gentleman may render\nOf whom he had this ring.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\n[_Aside._] What\u2019s that to him?\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThat diamond upon your finger, say\nHow came it yours?\n\nIACHIMO.\nThou\u2019lt torture me to leave unspoken that\nWhich to be spoke would torture thee.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHow? me?\n\nIACHIMO.\nI am glad to be constrain\u2019d to utter that\nWhich torments me to conceal. By villainy\nI got this ring; \u2019twas Leonatus\u2019 jewel,\nWhom thou didst banish; and\u2014which more may grieve thee,\nAs it doth me\u2014a nobler sir ne\u2019er liv\u2019d\n\u2019Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?\n\nCYMBELINE.\nAll that belongs to this.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThat paragon, thy daughter,\nFor whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits\nQuail to remember\u2014Give me leave, I faint.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nMy daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength;\nI had rather thou shouldst live while nature will\nThan die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak.\n\nIACHIMO.\nUpon a time, unhappy was the clock\nThat struck the hour: was in Rome, accurs\u2019d\nThe mansion where: \u2019twas at a feast, O, would\nOur viands had been poison\u2019d (or at least\nThose which I heav\u2019d to head) the good Posthumus\n(What should I say? he was too good to be\nWhere ill men were, and was the best of all\nAmongst the rar\u2019st of good ones) sitting sadly\nHearing us praise our loves of Italy\nFor beauty that made barren the swell\u2019d boast\nOf him that best could speak; for feature, laming\nThe shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva,\nPostures beyond brief nature; for condition,\nA shop of all the qualities that man\nLoves woman for; besides that hook of wiving,\nFairness which strikes the eye.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nI stand on fire.\nCome to the matter.\n\nIACHIMO.\nAll too soon I shall,\nUnless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,\nMost like a noble lord in love and one\nThat had a royal lover, took his hint;\nAnd (not dispraising whom we prais\u2019d, therein\nHe was as calm as virtue) he began\nHis mistress\u2019 picture; which by his tongue being made,\nAnd then a mind put in\u2019t, either our brags\nWere crack\u2019d of kitchen trulls, or his description\nProv\u2019d us unspeaking sots.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nNay, nay, to th\u2019 purpose.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYour daughter\u2019s chastity (there it begins)\nHe spake of her as Dian had hot dreams\nAnd she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,\nMade scruple of his praise, and wager\u2019d with him\nPieces of gold \u2019gainst this which then he wore\nUpon his honour\u2019d finger, to attain\nIn suit the place of\u2019s bed, and win this ring\nBy hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,\nNo lesser of her honour confident\nThan I did truly find her, stakes this ring;\nAnd would so, had it been a carbuncle\nOf Phoebus\u2019 wheel; and might so safely, had it\nBeen all the worth of\u2019s car. Away to Britain\nPost I in this design. Well may you, sir,\nRemember me at court, where I was taught\nOf your chaste daughter the wide difference\n\u2019Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench\u2019d\nOf hope, not longing, mine Italian brain\nGan in your duller Britain operate\nMost vilely; for my vantage, excellent;\nAnd, to be brief, my practice so prevail\u2019d\nThat I return\u2019d with simular proof enough\nTo make the noble Leonatus mad,\nBy wounding his belief in her renown\nWith tokens thus and thus; averring notes\nOf chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet\n(O cunning, how I got it!) nay, some marks\nOf secret on her person, that he could not\nBut think her bond of chastity quite crack\u2019d,\nI having ta\u2019en the forfeit. Whereupon\nMethinks I see him now\u2014\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\n[_Coming forward._] Ay, so thou dost,\nItalian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,\nEgregious murderer, thief, anything\nThat\u2019s due to all the villains past, in being,\nTo come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,\nSome upright justicer! Thou, King, send out\nFor torturers ingenious. It is I\nThat all th\u2019 abhorred things o\u2019 th\u2019 earth amend\nBy being worse than they. I am Posthumus,\nThat kill\u2019d thy daughter; villain-like, I lie;\nThat caus\u2019d a lesser villain than myself,\nA sacrilegious thief, to do\u2019t. The temple\nOf virtue was she; yea, and she herself.\nSpit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set\nThe dogs o\u2019 th\u2019 street to bay me. Every villain\nBe call\u2019d Posthumus Leonatus, and\nBe villainy less than \u2019twas! O Imogen!\nMy queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,\nImogen, Imogen!\n\nIMOGEN.\nPeace, my lord. Hear, hear!\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nShall\u2019s have a play of this? Thou scornful page,\nThere lies thy part.\n\n [_Strikes her. She falls._]\n\nPISANIO.\nO gentlemen, help!\nMine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!\nYou ne\u2019er kill\u2019d Imogen till now.

I, dreading that her purpose\nWas of more danger, did compound for her\nA certain stuff, which, being ta\u2019en would cease\nThe present pow\u2019r of life, but in short time\nAll offices of nature should again\nDo their due functions. Have you ta\u2019en of it?\n\nIMOGEN.\nMost like I did, for I was dead.\n\nBELARIUS.\nMy boys,\nThere was our error.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThis is sure Fidele.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhy did you throw your wedded lady from you?\nThink that you are upon a rock, and now\nThrow me again.\n\n [_Embracing him._]\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nHang there like fruit, my soul,\nTill the tree die!\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHow now, my flesh? my child?\nWhat, mak\u2019st thou me a dullard in this act?\nWilt thou not speak to me?\n\nIMOGEN.\n[_Kneeling._] Your blessing, sir.\n\nBELARIUS.\n[_To Guiderius and Arviragus._] Though you did love this youth, I blame\nye not;\nYou had a motive for\u2019t.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nMy tears that fall\nProve holy water on thee!

Lord Cloten,\nUpon my lady\u2019s missing, came to me\nWith his sword drawn, foam\u2019d at the mouth, and swore,\nIf I discover\u2019d not which way she was gone,\nIt was my instant death. By accident\nI had a feigned letter of my master\u2019s\nThen in my pocket, which directed him\nTo seek her on the mountains near to Milford;\nWhere, in a frenzy, in my master\u2019s garments,\nWhich he enforc\u2019d from me, away he posts\nWith unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate\nMy lady\u2019s honour. What became of him\nI further know not.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nLet me end the story:\nI slew him there.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nMarry, the gods forfend!\nI would not thy good deeds should from my lips\nPluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,\nDeny\u2019t again.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI have spoke it, and I did it.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHe was a prince.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nA most incivil one. The wrongs he did me\nWere nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me\nWith language that would make me spurn the sea,\nIf it could so roar to me. I cut off\u2019s head,\nAnd am right glad he is not standing here\nTo tell this tale of mine.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nI am sorry for thee.\nBy thine own tongue thou art condemn\u2019d, and must\nEndure our law. Thou\u2019rt dead.\n\nIMOGEN.\nThat headless man\nI thought had been my lord.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nBind the offender,\nAnd take him from our presence.\n\nBELARIUS.\nStay, sir King.\nThis man is better than the man he slew,\nAs well descended as thyself, and hath\nMore of thee merited than a band of Clotens\nHad ever scar for. [_To the guard._] Let his arms alone;\nThey were not born for bondage.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWhy, old soldier,\nWilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for\nBy tasting of our wrath? How of descent\nAs good as we?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nIn that he spake too far.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nAnd thou shalt die for\u2019t.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWe will die all three;\nBut I will prove that two on\u2019s are as good\nAs I have given out him. My sons, I must\nFor mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,\nThough haply well for you.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nYour danger\u2019s ours.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nAnd our good his.\n\nBELARIUS.\nHave at it then by leave!\nThou hadst, great King, a subject who\nWas call\u2019d Belarius.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWhat of him? He is\nA banish\u2019d traitor.\n\nBELARIUS.\nHe it is that hath\nAssum\u2019d this age; indeed a banish\u2019d man;\nI know not how a traitor.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nTake him hence,\nThe whole world shall not save him.\n\nBELARIUS.\nNot too hot.\nFirst pay me for the nursing of thy sons,\nAnd let it be confiscate all, so soon\nAs I have receiv\u2019d it.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nNursing of my sons?\n\nBELARIUS.\nI am too blunt and saucy: here\u2019s my knee.\nEre I arise I will prefer my sons;\nThen spare not the old father. Mighty sir,\nThese two young gentlemen that call me father,\nAnd think they are my sons, are none of mine;\nThey are the issue of your loins, my liege,\nAnd blood of your begetting.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHow? my issue?\n\nBELARIUS.\nSo sure as you your father\u2019s. I, old Morgan,\nAm that Belarius whom you sometime banish\u2019d.\nYour pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment\nItself, and all my treason; that I suffer\u2019d\nWas all the harm I did. These gentle princes\n(For such and so they are) these twenty years\nHave I train\u2019d up; those arts they have as I\nCould put into them. My breeding was, sir, as\nYour Highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,\nWhom for the theft I wedded, stole these children\nUpon my banishment; I mov\u2019d her to\u2019t,\nHaving receiv\u2019d the punishment before\nFor that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty\nExcited me to treason. Their dear loss,\nThe more of you \u2019twas felt, the more it shap\u2019d\nUnto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,\nHere are your sons again, and I must lose\nTwo of the sweet\u2019st companions in the world.\nThe benediction of these covering heavens\nFall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy\nTo inlay heaven with stars.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThou weep\u2019st and speak\u2019st.\nThe service that you three have done is more\nUnlike than this thou tell\u2019st. I lost my children.\nIf these be they, I know not how to wish\nA pair of worthier sons.\n\nBELARIUS.\nBe pleas\u2019d awhile.\nThis gentleman, whom I call Polydore,\nMost worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius;\nThis gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,\nYour younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp\u2019d\nIn a most curious mantle, wrought by th\u2019 hand\nOf his queen mother, which for more probation\nI can with ease produce.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nGuiderius had\nUpon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;\nIt was a mark of wonder.\n\nBELARIUS.\nThis is he,\nWho hath upon him still that natural stamp.\nIt was wise nature\u2019s end in the donation,\nTo be his evidence now.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nO, what am I?\nA mother to the birth of three? Ne\u2019er mother\nRejoic\u2019d deliverance more. Blest pray you be,\nThat, after this strange starting from your orbs,\nYou may reign in them now! O Imogen,\nThou hast lost by this a kingdom.\n\nIMOGEN.\nNo, my lord;\nI have got two worlds by\u2019t. O my gentle brothers,\nHave we thus met? O, never say hereafter\nBut I am truest speaker! You call\u2019d me brother,\nWhen I was but your sister: I you brothers,\nWhen we were so indeed.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nDid you e\u2019er meet?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nAnd at first meeting lov\u2019d,\nContinu\u2019d so until we thought he died.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nBy the Queen\u2019s dram she swallow\u2019d.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nO rare instinct!\nWhen shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgement\nHath to it circumstantial branches, which\nDistinction should be rich in. Where? how liv\u2019d you?\nAnd when came you to serve our Roman captive?\nHow parted with your brothers? how first met them?\nWhy fled you from the court? and whither? These,\nAnd your three motives to the battle, with\nI know not how much more, should be demanded,\nAnd all the other by-dependances,\nFrom chance to chance; but nor the time nor place\nWill serve our long interrogatories. See,\nPosthumus anchors upon Imogen;\nAnd she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye\nOn him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting\nEach object with a joy; the counterchange\nIs severally in all. Let\u2019s quit this ground,\nAnd smoke the temple with our sacrifices.\n[_To Belarius._] Thou art my brother; so we\u2019ll hold thee ever.\n\nIMOGEN.\nYou are my father too, and did relieve me\nTo see this gracious season.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nAll o\u2019erjoy\u2019d\nSave these in bonds. Let them be joyful too,\nFor they shall taste our comfort.\n\nIMOGEN.\nMy good master,\nI will yet do you service.\n\nLUCIUS.\nHappy be you!\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThe forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,\nHe would have well becom\u2019d this place and grac\u2019d\nThe thankings of a king.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI am, sir,\nThe soldier that did company these three\nIn poor beseeming; \u2019twas a fitment for\nThe purpose I then follow\u2019d. That I was he,\nSpeak, Iachimo. I had you down, and might\nHave made you finish.\n\nIACHIMO.\n[_Kneeling._] I am down again;\nBut now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,\nAs then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,\nWhich I so often owe; but your ring first,\nAnd here the bracelet of the truest princess\nThat ever swore her faith.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nKneel not to me.\nThe pow\u2019r that I have on you is to spare you;\nThe malice towards you to forgive you. Live,\nAnd deal with others better.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nNobly doom\u2019d!\nWe\u2019ll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;\nPardon\u2019s the word to all.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nYou holp us, sir,\nAs you did mean indeed to be our brother;\nJoy\u2019d are we that you are.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYour servant, Princes. Good my lord of Rome,\nCall forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought\nGreat Jupiter, upon his eagle back\u2019d,\nAppear\u2019d to me, with other spritely shows\nOf mine own kindred. When I wak\u2019d, I found\nThis label on my bosom; whose containing\nIs so from sense in hardness that I can\nMake no collection of it. Let him show\nHis skill in the construction.\n\nLUCIUS.\nPhilarmonus!\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nHere, my good lord.\n\nLUCIUS.\nRead, and declare the meaning.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\n[_Reads._] _When as a lion\u2019s whelp shall, to himself unknown, without\nseeking find, and be embrac\u2019d by a piece of tender air; and when from a\nstately cedar shall be lopp\u2019d branches which, being dead many years,\nshall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow; then\nshall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in\npeace and plenty._\nThou, Leonatus, art the lion\u2019s whelp;\nThe fit and apt construction of thy name,\nBeing Leo-natus, doth import so much.\n[_To Cymbeline_] The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,\nWhich we call _mollis aer_, and _mollis aer_\nWe term it _mulier_; which _mulier_ I divine\nIs this most constant wife, who even now\nAnswering the letter of the oracle,\nUnknown to you, unsought, were clipp\u2019d about\nWith this most tender air.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThis hath some seeming.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nThe lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,\nPersonates thee; and thy lopp\u2019d branches point\nThy two sons forth, who, by Belarius stol\u2019n,\nFor many years thought dead, are now reviv\u2019d,\nTo the majestic cedar join\u2019d, whose issue\nPromises Britain peace and plenty.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWell,\nMy peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,\nAlthough the victor, we submit to C\u00e6sar\nAnd to the Roman empire, promising\nTo pay our wonted tribute, from the which\nWe were dissuaded by our wicked queen,\nWhom heavens in justice, both on her and hers,\nHave laid most heavy hand.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nThe fingers of the pow\u2019rs above do tune\nThe harmony of this peace. The vision\nWhich I made known to Lucius ere the stroke\nOf yet this scarce-cold battle, at this instant\nIs full accomplish\u2019d; for the Roman eagle,\nFrom south to west on wing soaring aloft,\nLessen\u2019d herself and in the beams o\u2019 th\u2019 sun\nSo vanish\u2019d; which foreshow\u2019d our princely eagle,\nTh\u2019 imperial C\u00e6sar, C\u00e6sar, should again unite\nHis favour with the radiant Cymbeline,\nWhich shines here in the west.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nLaud we the gods;\nAnd let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils\nFrom our bless\u2019d altars. Publish we this peace\nTo all our subjects. Set we forward; let\nA Roman and a British ensign wave\nFriendly together. So through Lud\u2019s Town march;\nAnd in the temple of great Jupiter\nOur peace we\u2019ll ratify; seal it with feasts.\nSet on there! Never was a war did cease,\nEre bloody hands were wash\u2019d, with such a peace.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\n\n"
