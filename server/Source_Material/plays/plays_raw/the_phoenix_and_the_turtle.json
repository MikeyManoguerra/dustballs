"THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE\n\n\n\nLet the bird of loudest lay,\nOn the sole Arabian tree,\nHerald sad and trumpet be,\nTo whose sound chaste wings obey.\n\nBut thou shrieking harbinger,\nFoul precurrer of the fiend,\nAugur of the fever\u2019s end,\nTo this troop come thou not near.\n\nFrom this session interdict\nEvery fowl of tyrant wing,\nSave the eagle, feather\u2019d king;\nKeep the obsequy so strict.\n\nLet the priest in surplice white,\nThat defunctive music can,\nBe the death-divining swan,\nLest the requiem lack his right.\n\nAnd thou treble-dated crow,\nThat thy sable gender mak\u2019st\nWith the breath thou giv\u2019st and tak\u2019st,\n\u2019Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.\n\nHere the anthem doth commence:\nLove and constancy is dead;\nPhoenix and the turtle fled\nIn a mutual flame from hence.\n\nSo they lov\u2019d, as love in twain\nHad the essence but in one;\nTwo distincts, division none:\nNumber there in love was slain.\n\nHearts remote, yet not asunder;\nDistance and no space was seen\n\u2019Twixt this turtle and his queen;\nBut in them it were a wonder.\n\nSo between them love did shine,\nThat the turtle saw his right\nFlaming in the phoenix\u2019 sight;\nEither was the other\u2019s mine.\n\nProperty was thus appalled,\nThat the self was not the same;\nSingle nature\u2019s double name\nNeither two nor one was called.\n\nReason, in itself confounded,\nSaw division grow together;\nTo themselves yet either neither,\nSimple were so well compounded.\n\nThat it cried, How true a twain\nSeemeth this concordant one!\nLove hath reason, reason none,\nIf what parts can so remain.\n\nWhereupon it made this threne\nTo the phoenix and the dove,\nCo-supremes and stars of love,\nAs chorus to their tragic scene.\n\n\n       THRENOS\n\nBeauty, truth, and rarity.\nGrace in all simplicity,\nHere enclos\u2019d in cinders lie.\n\nDeath is now the phoenix\u2019 nest;\nAnd the turtle\u2019s loyal breast\nTo eternity doth rest.\n\nLeaving no posterity:\u2014\n\u2019Twas not their infirmity,\nIt was married chastity.\n\nTruth may seem, but cannot be;\nBeauty brag, but \u2019tis not she;\nTruth and beauty buried be.\n\nTo this urn let those repair\nThat are either true or fair;\nFor these dead birds sigh a prayer.\n\n\n"
