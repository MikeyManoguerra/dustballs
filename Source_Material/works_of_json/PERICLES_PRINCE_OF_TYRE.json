Here must I kill King Pericles;\nand if I do it not, I am sure to be hanged at home: \u2019tis dangerous. \nWell, I perceive he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,\nbeing bid to ask what he would of the king, desired he might know none\nof his secrets: now do I see he had some reason for\u2019t; for if a king\nbid a man be a villain, he\u2019s bound by the indenture of his oath to be\none. Husht, here come the lords of Tyre.\n\n Enter Helicanus and Escanes with other Lords of Tyre.\n\nHELICANUS.\nYou shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,\nFurther to question me of your king\u2019s departure:\nHis seal\u2019d commission, left in trust with me,\nDoth speak sufficiently he\u2019s gone to travel.\n\nTHALIARD.\n[_Aside._] How? the king gone?\n\nHELICANUS.\nIf further yet you will be satisfied,\nWhy, as it were unlicensed of your loves,\nHe would depart, I\u2019ll give some light unto you.\nBeing at Antioch \u2014\n\nTHALIARD.\n[_Aside._] What from Antioch?\n\nHELICANUS.\nRoyal Antiochus \u2014 on what cause I know not\nTook some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:\nAnd doubting lest that he had err\u2019d or sinn\u2019d,\nTo show his sorrow, he\u2019d correct himself;\nSo puts himself unto the shipman\u2019s toil,\nWith whom each minute threatens life or death.\n\nTHALIARD.\n[_Aside._] Well, I perceive\nI shall not be hang\u2019d now, although I would;\nBut since he\u2019s gone, the king\u2019s seas must please\nHe  \u2019scaped the land, to perish at the sea.\nI\u2019ll present myself.

They say they\u2019re half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,\nthey ne\u2019er come but I look to be washed. Master, I marvel how the\nfishes live in the sea.\n\nFIRST FISHERMAN.\nWhy, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the little ones: I can\ncompare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale; a\u2019 plays and\ntumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at last devours them all\nat a mouthful. Such whales have I heard on o\u2019 the land, who never leave\ngaping till they swallowed the whole parish, church, steeple, bells and\nall.\n\nPERICLES.\n[_Aside._] A pretty moral.\n\nTHIRD FISHERMAN.\nBut, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have been that day in\nthe belfry.\n\nSECOND FISHERMAN.\nWhy, man?\n\nTHIRD FISHERMAN.\nBecause he should have swallowed me too; and when I had been in his\nbelly, I would have kept such a jangling of the bells, that he should\nnever have left, till he cast bells, steeple, church and parish up\nagain.

Then I\u2019ll turn craver too, and so I shall \u2019scape whipping.\n\nPERICLES.\nWhy, are your beggars whipped, then?\n\nSECOND FISHERMAN.\nO, not all, my friend, not all; for if all your beggars were whipped, I\nwould wish no better office than to be beadle.

A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!\n\u2019Tis the king\u2019s subtlety to have my life.\nO, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,\nA stranger and distressed gentleman,\nThat never aim\u2019d so high to love your daughter,\nBut bent all offices to honour her.\n\nSIMONIDES.\nThou hast bewitch\u2019d my daughter,\nAnd thou art a villain.\n\nPERICLES.\nBy the gods, I have not:\nNever did thought of mine levy offence;\nNor never did my actions yet commence\nA deed might gain her love or your displeasure.\n\nSIMONIDES.\nTraitor, thou liest.\n\nPERICLES.\nTraitor?\n\nSIMONIDES.\nAy, traitor.\n\nPERICLES.\nEven in his throat \u2014 unless it be the king \u2014\nThat calls me traitor, I return the lie.\n\nSIMONIDES.\n[_Aside._] Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.\n\nPERICLES.\nMy actions are  as noble as my thoughts,\nThat never relish\u2019d of a base descent.\nI came unto your court for honour\u2019s cause,\nAnd not to be a rebel to her state;\nAnd he that otherwise accounts of me,\nThis sword shall prove he\u2019s honour\u2019s enemy.\n\nSIMONIDES.\nNo?\nHere comes my daughter, she can witness it.\n\n Enter Thaisa.\n\nPERICLES.\nThen, as you are as virtuous as fair,\nResolve your angry father, if my tongue\nDid e\u2019er solicit, or my hand subscribe\nTo any syllable that made love to you.\n\nTHAISA.\nWhy, sir, say if you had,\nWho takes offence at that would make me glad?\n\nSIMONIDES.\nYea, mistress, are you so peremptory?\n[_Aside._] I am glad on\u2019t with all my heart. \u2014\nI\u2019ll tame you; I\u2019ll bring you in subjection.\nWill you, not having my consent,\nBestow your love and your affections\nUpon a stranger? [_Aside._] Who, for aught I know\nMay be, nor can I think the contrary,\nAs great in blood as I myself. \u2014\nTherefore hear you, mistress; either frame\nYour will to mine, and you, sir, hear you,\nEither be ruled by me, or I will make you \u2014\nMan and wife. Nay, come, your hands,\nAnd lips must seal it too: and being join\u2019d,\nI\u2019ll thus your hopes destroy; and for further grief,\nGod give you joy! What, are you both pleased?\n\nTHAISA.\nYes, if you love me, sir.\n\nPERICLES.\nEven as my life my blood that fosters it.\n\nSIMONIDES.\nWhat, are you both agreed?\n\nBOTH.\nYes, if\u2019t please your majesty.\n\nSIMONIDES.\nIt pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed;\nAnd then with what haste you can, get you to bed.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n Enter Gower.\n\nGOWER.\nNow sleep yslaked hath the rouse;\nNo din but snores about the house,\nMade louder by the o\u2019erfed breast\nOf this most pompous marriage feast.\nThe cat, with eyne of burning coal,\nNow couches fore the mouse\u2019s hole;\nAnd crickets sing at the oven\u2019s mouth,\nAre the blither for their drouth.\nHymen hath brought the bride to bed,\nWhere, by the loss of maidenhead,\nA babe is moulded.  Be attent,\nAnd time that is so briefly spent\nWith your fine fancies quaintly eche:\nWhat\u2019s dumb in show I\u2019ll plain with speech.\n\n Dumb-show. Enter, Pericles and Simonides at one door with Attendants;\n a Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives Pericles a letter: Pericles\n shows it Simonides; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter Thaisa with\n child, with Lychorida, a nurse. The King shows her the letter; she\n rejoices:  she and Pericles take leave of her father, and depart, with\n Lychorida and their Attendants. Then exeunt Simonides and the rest.\n\nBy many a dern and painful perch\nOf Pericles the careful search,\nBy the four opposing coigns\nWhich the world together joins,\nIs made with all due diligence\nThat horse and sail and high expense\nCan stead the quest.  At last from Tyre,\nFame answering the most strange enquire,\nTo th\u2019 court of King Simonides\nAre letters brought, the tenour these:\nAntiochus and his daughter dead;\nThe men of Tyrus on the head\nOf Helicanus would set on\nThe crown of Tyre, but he will none:\nThe mutiny he there hastes t\u2019oppress;\nSays to \u2019em, if King Pericles\nCome not home in twice six moons,\nHe, obedient to their dooms,\nWill take the crown.  The sum of this,\nBrought hither to Pentapolis\nY-ravished the regions round,\nAnd everyone with claps can sound,\n\u2018Our heir apparent is a king!\nWho dreamt, who thought of such a thing?\u2019\nBrief, he must hence depart to Tyre:\nHis queen with child makes her desire \u2014\nWhich who shall cross? \u2014 along to go:\nOmit we all their dole and woe:\nLychorida, her nurse, she takes,\nAnd so to sea.  Their vessel shakes\nOn Neptune\u2019s billow; half the flood\nHath their keel cut: but fortune\u2019s mood\nVaries again; the grisled north\nDisgorges such a tempest forth,\nThat, as a duck for life that dives,\nSo up and down the poor ship drives:\nThe lady shrieks, and well-a-near\nDoes fall in travail with her fear:\nAnd what ensues in this fell storm\nShall for itself itself perform.\nI nill relate, action may\nConveniently the rest convey;\nWhich might not what by me is told.\nIn your imagination hold\nThis stage the ship, upon whose deck\nThe sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\nSCENE I.\n\n Enter Pericles, on shipboard.\n\nPERICLES.\nThou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,\nWhich wash both heaven and hell; and thou that hast\nUpon the winds command, bind them in brass,\nHaving call\u2019d them from the deep!

The seaman\u2019s whistle\nIs as a whisper in the ears of death,\nUnheard.  Lychorida! - Lucina, O!\nDivinest patroness, and midwife gentle\nTo those that cry by night, convey thy deity\nAboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs\nOf my queen\u2019s travails!

Happy what follows!\nThou hast as chiding a nativity\nAs fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,\nTo herald thee from the womb.\nEven at the first thy loss is more than can\nThy portage quit, with all thou canst find here,\nNow, the good gods throw their best eyes upon\u2019t!\n\n Enter two Sailors\n\nFIRST SAILOR.\nWhat courage, sir?  God save you!\n\nPERICLES.\nCourage enough: I do not fear the flaw;\nIt hath done to me the worst.  Yet, for the love\nOf this poor infant, this fresh new sea-farer,\nI would it would be quiet.\n\nFIRST SAILOR.\nSlack the bolins there!  Thou wilt not, wilt thou?  Blow, and split\nthyself.\n\nSECOND SAILOR.\nBut sea-room, and the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon, I care\nnot.\n\nFIRST SAILOR.\nSir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high, the wind is loud\nand will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead.\n\nPERICLES.\nThat\u2019s your superstition.\n\nFIRST SAILOR.\nPardon us, sir; with us at sea it has been still observed; and we are\nstrong in custom.  Therefore briefly yield her; for she must overboard\nstraight.\n\nPERICLES.\nAs you think meet.  Most wretched queen!\n\nLYCHORIDA.\nHere she lies, sir.\n\nPERICLES.\nA terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;\nNo light, no fire: th\u2019unfriendly elements\nForgot thee utterly; nor have I time\nTo give thee hallow\u2019d to thy grave, but straight\nMust cast thee, scarcely coffin\u2019d, in the ooze;\nWhere, for a monument upon thy bones,\nAnd e\u2019er-remaining lamps, the belching whale\nAnd humming water must o\u2019erwhelm thy corpse,\nLying with simple shells.  O Lychorida.\nBid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,\nMy casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander\nBring me the satin coffer: lay the babe\nUpon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say\nA priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.\n\n [_Exit Lychorida._]\n\nSECOND SAILOR.\nSir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked and bitumed ready.\n\nPERICLES.\nI thank thee.

If neglection\nShould therein make me vile, the common body,\nBy you relieved, would force me to my duty:\nBut if to that my nature need a spur,\nThe gods revenge it upon me and mine,\nTo the end of generation!\n\nPERICLES.\nI believe you;\nYour honour and your goodness teach me to\u2019t,\nWithout your vows. Till she be married, madam,\nBy bright Diana, whom we honour, all\nUnscissored shall this hair of mine remain,\nThough I show ill in\u2019t.  So I take my leave.\nGood madam, make me blessed in your care\nIn bringing up my child.\n\nDIONYZA.\nI have one myself,\nWho shall not be more dear to my respect\nThan yours, my lord.\n\nPERICLES.\nMadam, my thanks and prayers.\n\nCLEON.\nWe\u2019ll bring your grace e\u2019en to the edge o\u2019the shore,\nThen give you up to the mask\u2019d Neptune and\nThe gentlest winds of heaven.\n\nPERICLES.\nI will embrace your offer.

But, alack,\nThat monster envy, oft the wrack\nOf earned praise, Marina\u2019s life\nSeeks to take off by treason\u2019s knife,\nAnd in this kind our Cleon hath\nOne daughter, and a full grown wench\nEven ripe for marriage-rite; this maid\nHight Philoten: and it is said\nFor certain in our story, she\nWould ever with Marina be.\nBe\u2019t when she weaved the sleided silk\nWith fingers long, small, white as milk;\nOr when she would with sharp needle wound,\nThe cambric, which she made more sound\nBy hurting it; or when to th\u2019 lute\nShe sung, and made the night-bird mute\nThat still records with moan; or when\nShe would with rich and constant pen\nVail to her mistress Dian; still\nThis Philoten contends in skill\nWith absolute Marina: so\nThe dove of Paphos might with the crow\nVie feathers white.  Marina gets\nAll praises, which are paid as debts,\nAnd not as given. This so darks\nIn Philoten all graceful marks,\nThat Cleon\u2019s wife, with envy rare,\nA present murderer does prepare\nFor good Marina, that her daughter\nMight stand peerless by this slaughter.\nThe sooner her vile thoughts to stead,\nLychorida, our nurse, is dead:\nAnd cursed Dionyza hath\nThe pregnant instrument of wrath\nPrest for this blow.

Go, I pray you,\nWalk, and be cheerful once again; reserve\nThat excellent complexion, which did steal\nThe eyes of young and old. Care not for me;\nI can go home alone.\n\nMARINA.\nWell, I will go;\nBut yet I have no desire to it.\n\nDIONYZA.\nCome, come, I know \u2019tis good for you.\nWalk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:\nRemember what I have said.\n\nLEONINE.\nI warrant you, madam.\n\nDIONYZA.\nI\u2019ll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:\nPray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:\nWhat! I must have a care of you.\n\nMARINA.\nMy thanks, sweet madam.\n\n [_Exit Dionyza._]\n\nIs this wind westerly that blows?\n\nLEONINE.\nSouth-west.\n\nMARINA.\nWhen I was born the wind was north.\n\nLEONINE.\nWas\u2019t so?\n\nMARINA.\nMy father, as nurse said, did never fear,\nBut cried \u2018Good seamen!\u2019 to the sailors,\nGalling his kingly hands, haling ropes;\nAnd clasping to the mast, endured a sea\nThat almost burst the deck.\n\nLEONINE.\nWhen was this?\n\nMARINA.\nWhen I was born:\nNever was waves nor wind more violent;\nAnd from the ladder tackle washes off\nA canvas-climber. \u2018Ha!\u2019 says one, \u2018wolt out?\u2019\nAnd with a dropping industry they skip\nFrom stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and\nThe master calls and trebles their confusion.\n\nLEONINE.\nCome, say your prayers.\n\nMARINA.\nWhat mean you?\n\nLEONINE.\nIf you require a little space for prayer,\nI grant it: pray; but be not tedious,\nFor the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn\nTo do my work with haste.\n\nMARINA.\nWhy will you kill me?\n\nLEONINE.\nTo satisfy my lady.\n\nMARINA.\nWhy would she have me kill\u2019d now?\nAs I can remember, by my troth,\nI never did her hurt in all my life:\nI never spake bad word, nor did ill turn\nTo any living creature: believe me, la,\nI never kill\u2019d a mouse, nor hurt a fly:\nI trod upon a worm against my will,\nBut I wept for it.  How have I offended,\nWherein my death might yield her any profit,\nOr my life imply her any danger?\n\nLEONINE.\nMy commission\nIs not to reason of the deed, but do it.\n\nMARINA.\nYou will not do\u2019t for all the world, I hope.\nYou are well favour\u2019d, and your looks foreshow\nYou have a gentle heart.  I saw you lately,\nWhen you caught hurt in parting two that fought:\nGood sooth, it show\u2019d well in you: do so now:\nYour lady seeks my life; come you between,\nAnd save poor me, the weaker.\n\nLEONINE.\nI am sworn,\nAnd will dispatch.\n\n [_He seizes her._]\n\n Enter Pirates.\n\nFIRST PIRATE.\nHold, villain!\n\n [_Leonine runs away._]\n\nSECOND PIRATE.\nA prize! a prize!\n\nTHIRD PIRATE.\nHalf part, mates, half part,\nCome, let\u2019s have her aboard suddenly.\n\n [_Exeunt Pirates with Marina._]\n\n Re-enter Leonine.\n\nLEONINE.\nThese roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;\nAnd they have seized Marina. Let her go:\nThere\u2019s no hope she will return. I\u2019ll swear she\u2019s dead\nAnd thrown into the sea. But I\u2019ll see further:\nPerhaps they will but please themselves upon her,\nNot carry her aboard.  If she remain,\nWhom they have ravish\u2019d must by me be slain.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\nScene II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.\n\n Enter Pandar, Bawd and  Boult.\n\nPANDAR.\nBoult!\n\nBOULT.\nSir?\n\nPANDAR.\nSearch the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of gallants. We lost too\nmuch money this mart by being too wenchless.\n\nBAWD.\nWe were never so much out of creatures. We have but poor three, and\nthey can do no more than they can do; and they with continual action\nare even as good as rotten.\n\nPANDAR.\nTherefore let\u2019s have fresh ones, whate\u2019er we pay for them. If there be\nnot a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall never prosper.\n\nBAWD.\nThou sayest true: \u2019tis not our bringing up of poor bastards, \u2014 as, I\nthink, I have brought up some eleven \u2014\n\nBOULT.\nAy, to eleven; and brought them down again. But shall I search the\nmarket?\n\nBAWD.\nWhat else, man?  The stuff we have, a strong wind will blow it to\npieces, they are so pitifully sodden.\n\nPANDAR.\nThou sayest true; they\u2019re too unwholesome, o\u2019 conscience. The poor\nTransylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage.\n\nBOULT.\nAy, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms. But I\u2019ll\ngo search the market.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPANDAR.\nThree or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live\nquietly, and so give over.\n\nBAWD.\nWhy to give over, I pray you? Is it a shame to get when we are old?\n\nPANDAR.\nO, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages\nnot with the danger: therefore, if in our youths we could pick up some\npretty estate, \u2019twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.  Besides, the\nsore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for\ngiving over.\n\nBAWD.\nCome, others sorts offend as well as we.\n\nPANDAR.\nAs well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse. Neither is our\nprofession any trade; it\u2019s no calling.  But here comes Boult.\n\n Re-enter Boult, with the Pirates and Marina.\n\nBOULT\n[_To Pirates._] Come your ways. My masters, you say she\u2019s a virgin?\n\nFIRST PIRATE.\nO sir, we doubt it not.\n\nBOULT.\nMaster, I have gone through for this piece, you see: if you like her,\nso; if not, I have lost my earnest.\n\nBAWD.\nBoult, has she any qualities?\n\nBOULT.\nShe has a good face, speaks well and has excellent good clothes:\nthere\u2019s no farther necessity of qualities can make her be refused.\n\nBAWD.\nWhat is her price, Boult?\n\nBOULT.\nI cannot be baited one doit of a thousand pieces.\n\nPANDAR.\nWell, follow me, my masters, you shall have your money presently. Wife,\ntake her in; instruct her what she has to do, that she may not be raw\nin her entertainment.\n\n [_Exeunt Pandar and Pirates._]\n\nBAWD.\nBoult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her hair, complexion,\nheight, her age, with warrant of her virginity; and cry \u2018He that will\ngive most shall have her first.\u2019 Such a maidenhead were no cheap thing,\nif men were as they have been. Get this done as I command you.\n\nBOULT.\nPerformance shall follow.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nMARINA.\nAlack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!\nHe should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,\nNot enough barbarous, had not o\u2019erboard thrown me\nFor to seek my mother!\n\nBAWD.\nWhy lament you, pretty one?\n\nMARINA.\nThat I am pretty.\n\nBAWD.\nCome, the gods have done their part in you.\n\nMARINA.\nI accuse them not.\n\nBAWD.\nYou are light into my hands, where you are like to live.\n\nMARINA.\nThe more my fault\nTo scape his hands where I was like to die.\n\nBAWD.\nAy, and you shall live in pleasure.\n\nMARINA.\nNo.\n\nBAWD.\nYes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all fashions: you shall\nfare well; you shall have the difference of all complexions. What! do\nyou stop your ears?\n\nMARINA.\nAre you a woman?\n\nBAWD.\nWhat would you have me be, an I be not a woman?\n\nMARINA.\nAn honest woman, or not a woman.\n\nBAWD.\nMarry, whip the gosling: I think I shall have something to do with you.\nCome, you\u2019re a young foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have\nyou.\n\nMARINA.\nThe gods defend me!\n\nBAWD.\nIf it please the gods to defend you by men, then men must comfort you,\nmen must feed you, men stir you up. Boult\u2019s returned.\n\n Re-enter Boult.\n\nNow, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?\n\nBOULT.\nI have cried her almost to the number of her hairs; I have drawn her\npicture with my voice.\n\nBAWD.\nAnd I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the\npeople, especially of the younger sort?\n\nBOULT.\nFaith, they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their\nfather\u2019s testament.  There was a Spaniard\u2019s mouth so watered, that he\nwent to bed to her very description.\n\nBAWD.\nWe shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on.\n\nBOULT.\nTonight, tonight. But, mistress, do you know the French knight that\ncowers i\u2019 the hams?\n\nBAWD.\nWho, Monsieur Veroles?\n\nBOULT.\nAy, he: he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation; but he made a\ngroan at it, and swore he would see her tomorrow.\n\nBAWD.\nWell, well, as for him, he brought his disease hither: here he does but\nrepair it. I know he will come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in\nthe sun.\n\nBOULT.\nWell, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them with\nthis sign.\n\n[_To Marina._] Pray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming\nupon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit\nwillingly, despise profit where you have most gain. To weep that you\nlive as ye do makes pity in your lovers: seldom but that pity begets\nyou a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.\n\nMARINA.\nI understand you not.\n\nBOULT.\nO, take her home, mistress, take her home: these blushes of hers must\nbe quenched with some present practice.\n\nBAWD.\nThou sayest true, i\u2019faith so they must; for your bride goes to that\nwith shame which is her way to go with warrant.\n\nBOULT.\nFaith, some do and some do not. But, mistress, if I have bargained for\nthe joint, \u2014\n\nBAWD.\nThou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.\n\nBOULT.\nI may so.\n\nBAWD. Who should deny it? Come young one, I like the manner of your\ngarments well.\n\nBOULT.\nAy, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.\n\nBAWD.\nBoult, spend thou that in the town: report what a sojourner we have;\nyou\u2019ll lose nothing by custom. When nature framed this piece, she meant\nthee a good turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou hast\nthe harvest out of thine own report.\n\nBOULT.\nI warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as\nmy giving out her beauty stirs up the lewdly inclined. I\u2019ll bring home\nsome tonight.\n\nBAWD.\nCome your ways; follow me.\n\nMARINA.\nIf fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,\nUntied I still my virgin knot will keep.\nDiana, aid my purpose!\n\nBAWD.\nWhat have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nSCENE III. Tarsus. A room in Cleon\u2019s house.\n\n Enter Cleon and Dionyza.\n\nDIONYZA.\nWhy, are you foolish?  Can it be undone?\n\nCLEON.\nO, Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter\nThe sun and moon ne\u2019er look\u2019d upon!\n\nDIONYZA.\nI think you\u2019ll turn a child again.\n\nCLEON.\nWere I chief lord of all this spacious world,\nI\u2019d give it to undo the deed. A lady,\nMuch less in blood than virtue, yet a princess\nTo equal any single crown o\u2019 the earth\nI\u2019 the justice of compare!  O villain Leonine!\nWhom thou hast poison\u2019d too:\nIf thou hadst drunk to him, \u2019t had been a kindness\nBecoming well thy face. What canst thou say\nWhen noble Pericles shall demand his child?\n\nDIONYZA.\nThat she is dead.  Nurses are not the fates,\nTo foster it, nor ever to preserve.\nShe died at night; I\u2019ll say so. Who can cross it?\nUnless you play the pious innocent,\nAnd for an honest attribute cry out\n\u2018She died by foul play.\u2019\n\nCLEON.\nO, go to.  Well, well,\nOf all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods\nDo like this worst.\n\nDIONYZA.\nBe one of those that thinks\nThe petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,\nAnd open this to Pericles. I do shame\nTo think of what a noble strain you are,\nAnd of how coward a spirit.\n\nCLEON.\nTo such proceeding\nWhoever but his approbation added,\nThough not his prime consent, he did not flow\nFrom honourable sources,\n\nDIONYZA.\nBe it so, then:\nYet none does know, but you, how she came dead,\nNor none can know, Leonine being gone.\nShe did distain my child, and stood between\nHer and her fortunes: none would look on her,\nBut cast their gazes on Marina\u2019s face;\nWhilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin\nNot worth the time of day.  It pierced me through;\nAnd though you call my course unnatural,\nYou not your child well loving, yet I find\nIt greets me as an enterprise of kindness\nPerform\u2019d to your sole daughter.\n\nCLEON.\nHeavens forgive it!\n\nDIONYZA.\nAnd as for Pericles, what should he say?\nWe wept after her hearse, and yet we mourn.\nHer monument is almost finish\u2019d, and her epitaphs\nIn glittering golden characters express\nA general praise to her, and care in us\nAt whose expense \u2019tis done.\n\nCLEON.\nThou art like the harpy,\nWhich, to betray, dost, with thine angel\u2019s face,\nSeize with thine eagle\u2019s talons.\n\nDIONYZA.\nYou are like one that superstitiously\nDoth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:\nBut yet I know you\u2019ll do as I advise.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n Enter Gower, before the monument of Marina at Tarsus.\n\nGOWER.\nThus time we waste, and long leagues make short;\nSail seas in cockles, have and wish but for\u2019t;\nMaking, to take your imagination,\nFrom bourn to bourn, region to region.\nBy you  being pardon\u2019d, we commit no crime\nTo use one language in each several clime\nWhere our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you\nTo learn of me, who stand i\u2019the gaps to teach you,\nThe stages of our story.  Pericles\nIs now again thwarting the wayward seas\nAttended on by many a lord and knight,\nTo see his daughter, all his life\u2019s delight.\nOld Helicanus goes along. Behind\nIs left to govern, if you bear in mind,\nOld Escanes, whom Helicanus late\nAdvanced in time to great and high estate.\nWell-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought\nThis king to Tarsus, \u2014 think his pilot thought;\nSo with his steerage shall your thoughts go on, \u2014\nTo fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.\nLike motes and shadows see them move awhile;\nYour ears unto your eyes I\u2019ll reconcile.\n\n Dumb-show. Enter Pericles at one door with all his train; Cleon and\n Dionyza at the other. Cleon shows Pericles the tomb; whereat Pericles\n makes lamentation, puts on sackcloth and in a mighty passion departs.\n Then exeunt Cleon and Dionyza.\n\nSee how belief may suffer by foul show;\nThis borrow\u2019d passion stands for true old woe;\nAnd Pericles, in sorrow all devour\u2019d,\nWith sighs shot through; and biggest tears o\u2019ershower\u2019d,\nLeaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears\nNever to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:\nHe puts on sackcloth, and to sea he bears\nA tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,\nAnd yet he rides it out. Now please you wit\nThe epitaph is for Marina writ\nBy wicked Dionyza.\n\n [_Reads the inscription on Marina\u2019s monument._]\n\n     _The fairest, sweet\u2019st, and best lies here,\n     Who wither\u2019d in her spring of year.\n     She was of Tyrus the King\u2019s daughter,\n     On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;\n     Marina was she call\u2019d; and at her birth,\n     Thetis, being proud, swallow\u2019d some part o\u2019 the earth:\n     Therefore the earth, fearing to be o\u2019erflow\u2019d,\n     Hath Thetis\u2019 birth-child on the heavens bestow\u2019d:\n     Wherefore she does, and swears she\u2019ll never stint,\n     Make raging battery upon shores of flint._\n\nNo visor does become black villany\nSo well as soft and tender flattery.\nLet Pericles believe his daughter\u2019s dead,\nAnd bear his courses to be ordered\nBy Lady Fortune; while our scene must play\nHis daughter\u2019s woe and heavy well-a-day\nIn her unholy service. Patience, then,\nAnd think you now are all in Mytilene.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\nSCENE V. Mytilene.

Come, I am for no more bawdy houses: shall\u2019s go hear the\nvestals sing?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nI\u2019ll do anything now that is virtuous; but I am out of the road of\nrutting for ever.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.

She\u2019s able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a\nwhole generation. We must either get her ravished, or be rid of her.\nWhen she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the kindness of\nour profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons, her master reasons,\nher prayers, her knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil, if\nhe should cheapen a kiss of her.\n\nBOULT.\nFaith, I must ravish her, or she\u2019ll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers,\nand make our swearers priests.\n\nPANDAR.\nNow, the pox upon her green sickness for me!\n\nBAWD.\nFaith, there\u2019s no way to be rid on\u2019t but by the way to the pox.\nHere comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.\n\nBOULT.\nWe should have both lord and lown, if the peevish baggage would but\ngive way to customers.\n\n Enter Lysimachus.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nHow now!  How a dozen of virginities?\n\nBAWD.\nNow, the gods to bless your honour!\n\nBOULT.\nI am glad to see your honour in good health.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nYou may so; \u2019tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon\nsound legs. How now? Wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal\nwithal, and defy the surgeon?\n\nBAWD.\nWe have here one, sir, if she would \u2014 but there never came her like in\nMytilene.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nIf she\u2019d do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.\n\nBAWD.\nYour honour knows what \u2019tis to say well enough.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nWell, call forth, call forth.\n\nBOULT.\nFor flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall see a rose; and she\nwere a rose indeed, if she had but \u2014\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nWhat, prithee?\n\nBOULT.\nO, sir, I can be modest.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nThat dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it gives a good report\nto a number to be chaste.\n\n [_Exit Boult._]\n\nBAWD.\nHere comes that which grows to the stalk; never plucked yet, I can\nassure you.\n\n Re-enter Boult with Marina.\n\nIs she not a fair creature?\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nFaith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea. Well, there\u2019s for\nyou:  leave us.\n\nBAWD.\nI beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and I\u2019ll have done\npresently.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nI beseech you, do.\n\nBAWD.\n[_To Marina._] First, I would have you note, this is an honourable man.\n\nMARINA.\nI desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.\n\nBAWD.\nNext, he\u2019s the governor of this country, and a man whom I am bound to.\n\nMARINA.\nIf he govern the country, you are bound to him indeed; but how\nhonourable he is in that, I know not.\n\nBAWD.

Go thy\nways.\n\n [_Exeunt Bawd, Pandar and Boult._]\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nNow, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?\n\nMARINA.\nWhat trade, sir?\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nWhy, I cannot name\u2019t but I shall offend.\n\nMARINA.\nI cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nHow long have you been of this profession?\n\nMARINA.\nE\u2019er since I can remember.\n\nLYSIMACHUS. Did you go to\u2019t so young?

Some more; be sage.\n\nMARINA.\nFor me,\nThat am a maid, though most ungentle Fortune\nHave placed me in this sty, where, since I came,\nDiseases have been sold dearer than physic,\nO, that the gods\nWould set me free from this unhallow\u2019d place,\nThough they did change me to the meanest bird\nThat flies i\u2019 the purer air!\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nI did not think\nThou couldst have spoke so well; ne\u2019er dream\u2019d thou couldst.\nHad I brought hither a corrupted mind,\nThy speech had alter\u2019d it.
