Sixty and nine that wore\nTheir crownets regal from the Athenian bay\nPut forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made\nTo ransack Troy, within whose strong immures\nThe ravish\u2019d Helen, Menelaus\u2019 queen,\nWith wanton Paris sleeps\u2014and that\u2019s the quarrel.\nTo Tenedos they come,\nAnd the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge\nTheir war-like fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains\nThe fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch\nTheir brave pavilions: Priam\u2019s six-gated city,\nDardan, and Tymbria, Ilias, Chetas, Troien,\nAnd Antenorides, with massy staples\nAnd corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,\nStir up the sons of Troy.\nNow expectation, tickling skittish spirits\nOn one and other side, Trojan and Greek,\nSets all on hazard. And hither am I come\nA prologue arm\u2019d, but not in confidence\nOf author\u2019s pen or actor\u2019s voice, but suited\nIn like conditions as our argument,\nTo tell you, fair beholders, that our play\nLeaps o\u2019er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,\nBeginning in the middle; starting thence away,\nTo what may be digested in a play.\nLike or find fault; do as your pleasures are;\nNow good or bad, \u2019tis but the chance of war.\n\n\n"}, "body": [[{"title": "the history of troilus and cressida", "author_first_name": "william", "author_last_name": "shakespeare", "act": 1, "scene": 1, "direction": "", "text": [{"type": "direction", "direction": ""}, {"type": "direction", "direction": "Enter Troilus armed, and Pandarus."}, {"type": "dialouge", "character": "TROILUS.", "line": "Call here my varlet; I\u2019ll unarm again.\nWhy should I war without the walls of Troy\nThat find such cruel battle here within?\nEach Trojan that is master of his heart,\nLet him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none."}, {"type": "dialouge", "character": "PANDARUS.", "line": "Will this gear ne\u2019er be mended?"}, {"type": "dialouge", "character": "TROILUS.", "line": "The Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,\nFierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;\nBut I am weaker than a woman\u2019s tear,\nTamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,\nLess valiant than the virgin in the night,\nAnd skilless as unpractis\u2019d infancy."}, {"type": "dialouge", "character": "PANDARUS.", "line": "Well, I have told you enough of this; for my part, I\u2019ll not meddle nor\nmake no farther.
