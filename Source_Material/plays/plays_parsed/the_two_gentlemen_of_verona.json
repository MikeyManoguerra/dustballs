When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,\r\n  it goes hard- one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav'd from\r\n  drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went\r\n  to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely 'Thus I\r\n  would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him as a present to\r\n  Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the\r\n  dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher and steals her\r\n  capon's leg. O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in\r\n  all companies! I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon\r\n  him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I\r\n  had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I\r\n  think verily he had been hang'd for't; sure as I live, he had\r\n  suffer'd for't. You shall judge. He thrusts me himself into the\r\n  company of three or four gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table;\r\n  he had not been there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the\r\n  chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?'\r\n  says another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the\r\n  Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was\r\n  Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs. 'Friend,' quoth\r\n  I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I' quoth he. 'You do him\r\n  the more wrong,' quoth I; \"twas I did the thing you wot of.' He makes\r\n  me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters\r\n  would do this for his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the\r\n  stock for puddings he hath stol'n, otherwise he had been executed; I\r\n  have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill'd, otherwise he had\r\n  suffer'd for't. Thou think'st not of this now. Nay, I remember the\r\n  trick you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I\r\n  bid thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave\r\n  up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?
