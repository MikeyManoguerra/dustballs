SCENE I. A Room of State in King Lear\u2019s Palace.\n\n Enter Kent, Gloucester and Edmund.\n\nKENT.\nI thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nIt did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom,\nit appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for qualities are so\nweighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either\u2019s moiety.\n\nKENT.\nIs not this your son, my lord?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHis breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blush\u2019d to\nacknowledge him that now I am braz\u2019d to\u2019t.\n\nKENT.\nI cannot conceive you.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nSir, this young fellow\u2019s mother could; whereupon she grew round-wombed,\nand had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her\nbed. Do you smell a fault?\n\nKENT.\nI cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nBut I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who\nyet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came something\nsaucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair;\nthere was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be\nacknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?\n\nEDMUND.\nNo, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nMy Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.\n\nEDMUND.\nMy services to your lordship.\n\nKENT.\nI must love you, and sue to know you better.\n\nEDMUND.\nSir, I shall study deserving.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHe hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The King is\ncoming.\n\n [_Sennet within._]\n\n Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and Attendants.\n\nLEAR.\nAttend the lords of France and Burgundy,\nGloucester.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI shall, my lord.\n\n [_Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund._]\n\nLEAR.\nMeantime we shall express our darker purpose.\nGive me the map there. Know that we have divided\nIn three our kingdom: and \u2019tis our fast intent\nTo shake all cares and business from our age;\nConferring them on younger strengths, while we\nUnburden\u2019d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,\nAnd you, our no less loving son of Albany,\nWe have this hour a constant will to publish\nOur daughters\u2019 several dowers, that future strife\nMay be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,\nGreat rivals in our youngest daughter\u2019s love,\nLong in our court have made their amorous sojourn,\nAnd here are to be answer\u2019d. Tell me, my daughters,\u2014\nSince now we will divest us both of rule,\nInterest of territory, cares of state,\u2014\nWhich of you shall we say doth love us most?\nThat we our largest bounty may extend\nWhere nature doth with merit challenge.\u2014Goneril,\nOur eldest born, speak first.\n\nGONERIL.\nSir, I love you more than word can wield the matter;\nDearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;\nBeyond what can be valu\u2019d, rich or rare;\nNo less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;\nAs much as child e\u2019er lov\u2019d, or father found;\nA love that makes breath poor and speech unable;\nBeyond all manner of so much I love you.\n\nCORDELIA.\n[_Aside._] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.\n\nLEAR.\nOf all these bounds, even from this line to this,\nWith shadowy forests and with champains rich\u2019d,\nWith plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,\nWe make thee lady: to thine and Albany\u2019s issue\nBe this perpetual.\u2014What says our second daughter,\nOur dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.\n\nREGAN.\nSir, I am made of the self mettle as my sister,\nAnd prize me at her worth. In my true heart\nI find she names my very deed of love;\nOnly she comes too short, that I profess\nMyself an enemy to all other joys\nWhich the most precious square of sense possesses,\nAnd find I am alone felicitate\nIn your dear highness\u2019 love.\n\nCORDELIA.\n[_Aside._] Then poor Cordelia,\nAnd yet not so; since, I am sure, my love\u2019s\nMore ponderous than my tongue.\n\nLEAR.\nTo thee and thine hereditary ever\nRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom;\nNo less in space, validity, and pleasure\nThan that conferr\u2019d on Goneril.\u2014Now, our joy,\nAlthough the last and least; to whose young love\nThe vines of France and milk of Burgundy\nStrive to be interess\u2019d; what can you say to draw\nA third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.\n\nCORDELIA.\nNothing, my lord.\n\nLEAR.\nNothing?\n\nCORDELIA.\nNothing.\n\nLEAR.\nNothing will come of nothing: speak again.\n\nCORDELIA.\nUnhappy that I am, I cannot heave\nMy heart into my mouth: I love your majesty\nAccording to my bond; no more nor less.\n\nLEAR.\nHow, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,\nLest you may mar your fortunes.\n\nCORDELIA.\nGood my lord,\nYou have begot me, bred me, lov\u2019d me: I\nReturn those duties back as are right fit,\nObey you, love you, and most honour you.\nWhy have my sisters husbands if they say\nThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,\nThat lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry\nHalf my love with him, half my care and duty:\nSure I shall never marry like my sisters,\nTo love my father all.\n\nLEAR.\nBut goes thy heart with this?\n\nCORDELIA.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nLEAR.\nSo young, and so untender?\n\nCORDELIA.\nSo young, my lord, and true.\n\nLEAR.\nLet it be so, thy truth then be thy dower:\nFor, by the sacred radiance of the sun,\nThe mysteries of Hecate and the night;\nBy all the operation of the orbs,\nFrom whom we do exist and cease to be;\nHere I disclaim all my paternal care,\nPropinquity and property of blood,\nAnd as a stranger to my heart and me\nHold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,\nOr he that makes his generation messes\nTo gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\nBe as well neighbour\u2019d, pitied, and reliev\u2019d,\nAs thou my sometime daughter.\n\nKENT.\nGood my liege,\u2014\n\nLEAR.\nPeace, Kent!\nCome not between the dragon and his wrath.\nI lov\u2019d her most, and thought to set my rest\nOn her kind nursery. [_To Cordelia._] Hence and avoid my sight!\nSo be my grave my peace, as here I give\nHer father\u2019s heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?\nCall Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,\nWith my two daughters\u2019 dowers digest this third:\nLet pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.\nI do invest you jointly with my power,\nPre-eminence, and all the large effects\nThat troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,\nWith reservation of an hundred knights,\nBy you to be sustain\u2019d, shall our abode\nMake with you by due turn. Only we shall retain\nThe name, and all the addition to a king; the sway,\nRevenue, execution of the rest,\nBeloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,\nThis coronet part between you.\n [_Giving the crown._]\n\nKENT.\nRoyal Lear,\nWhom I have ever honour\u2019d as my king,\nLov\u2019d as my father, as my master follow\u2019d,\nAs my great patron thought on in my prayers.\u2014\n\nLEAR.\nThe bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.\n\nKENT.\nLet it fall rather, though the fork invade\nThe region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly\nWhen Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?\nThink\u2019st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,\nWhen power to flattery bows? To plainness honour\u2019s bound\nWhen majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state;\nAnd in thy best consideration check\nThis hideous rashness: answer my life my judgement,\nThy youngest daughter does not love thee least;\nNor are those empty-hearted, whose low sounds\nReverb no hollowness.\n\nLEAR.\nKent, on thy life, no more.\n\nKENT.\nMy life I never held but as a pawn\nTo wage against thine enemies; ne\u2019er fear to lose it,\nThy safety being the motive.\n\nLEAR.\nOut of my sight!\n\nKENT.\nSee better, Lear; and let me still remain\nThe true blank of thine eye.\n\nLEAR.\nNow, by Apollo,\u2014\n\nKENT.\nNow by Apollo, King,\nThou swear\u2019st thy gods in vain.\n\nLEAR.\nO vassal! Miscreant!\n\n [_Laying his hand on his sword._]\n\nALBANY and CORNWALL.\nDear sir, forbear!\n\nKENT.\nKill thy physician, and the fee bestow\nUpon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,\nOr, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,\nI\u2019ll tell thee thou dost evil.\n\nLEAR.\nHear me, recreant! on thine allegiance, hear me!\nSince thou hast sought to make us break our vows,\nWhich we durst never yet, and with strain\u2019d pride\nTo come betwixt our sentences and our power,\nWhich nor our nature, nor our place can bear,\nOur potency made good, take thy reward.\nFive days we do allot thee for provision,\nTo shield thee from disasters of the world;\nAnd on the sixth to turn thy hated back\nUpon our kingdom: if, on the next day following,\nThy banish\u2019d trunk be found in our dominions,\nThe moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,\nThis shall not be revok\u2019d.\n\nKENT.\nFare thee well, King: sith thus thou wilt appear,\nFreedom lives hence, and banishment is here.\n[_To Cordelia._] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,\nThat justly think\u2019st and hast most rightly said!\n[_To Goneril and Regan._] And your large speeches may your deeds\napprove,\nThat good effects may spring from words of love.\nThus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;\nHe\u2019ll shape his old course in a country new.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n Flourish. Re-enter Gloucester, with France, Burgundy and Attendants.\n\nCORDELIA.\nHere\u2019s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.\n\nLEAR.\nMy Lord of Burgundy,\nWe first address toward you, who with this king\nHath rivall\u2019d for our daughter: what in the least\nWill you require in present dower with her,\nOr cease your quest of love?\n\nBURGUNDY.\nMost royal majesty,\nI crave no more than hath your highness offer\u2019d,\nNor will you tender less?\n\nLEAR.\nRight noble Burgundy,\nWhen she was dear to us, we did hold her so;\nBut now her price is fall\u2019n. Sir, there she stands:\nIf aught within that little-seeming substance,\nOr all of it, with our displeasure piec\u2019d,\nAnd nothing more, may fitly like your grace,\nShe\u2019s there, and she is yours.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nI know no answer.\n\nLEAR.\nWill you, with those infirmities she owes,\nUnfriended, new adopted to our hate,\nDower\u2019d with our curse, and stranger\u2019d with our oath,\nTake her or leave her?\n\nBURGUNDY.\nPardon me, royal sir;\nElection makes not up in such conditions.\n\nLEAR.\nThen leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,\nI tell you all her wealth. [_To France_] For you, great king,\nI would not from your love make such a stray\nTo match you where I hate; therefore beseech you\nT\u2019avert your liking a more worthier way\nThan on a wretch whom nature is asham\u2019d\nAlmost t\u2019acknowledge hers.\n\nFRANCE.\nThis is most strange,\nThat she, who even but now was your best object,\nThe argument of your praise, balm of your age,\nThe best, the dearest, should in this trice of time\nCommit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle\nSo many folds of favour. Sure her offence\nMust be of such unnatural degree\nThat monsters it, or your fore-vouch\u2019d affection\nFall into taint; which to believe of her\nMust be a faith that reason without miracle\nShould never plant in me.\n\nCORDELIA.\nI yet beseech your majesty,\nIf for I want that glib and oily art\nTo speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,\nI\u2019ll do\u2019t before I speak,\u2014that you make known\nIt is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,\nNo unchaste action or dishonour\u2019d step,\nThat hath depriv\u2019d me of your grace and favour;\nBut even for want of that for which I am richer,\nA still soliciting eye, and such a tongue\nAs I am glad I have not, though not to have it\nHath lost me in your liking.\n\nLEAR.\nBetter thou hadst\nNot been born than not to have pleas\u2019d me better.\n\nFRANCE.\nIs it but this?\u2014a tardiness in nature\nWhich often leaves the history unspoke\nThat it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,\nWhat say you to the lady? Love\u2019s not love\nWhen it is mingled with regards that stands\nAloof from the entire point. Will you have her?\nShe is herself a dowry.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nRoyal King,\nGive but that portion which yourself propos\u2019d,\nAnd here I take Cordelia by the hand,\nDuchess of Burgundy.\n\nLEAR.\nNothing: I have sworn; I am firm.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nI am sorry, then, you have so lost a father\nThat you must lose a husband.\n\nCORDELIA.\nPeace be with Burgundy!\nSince that respects of fortunes are his love,\nI shall not be his wife.\n\nFRANCE.\nFairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;\nMost choice forsaken; and most lov\u2019d, despis\u2019d!\nThee and thy virtues here I seize upon:\nBe it lawful, I take up what\u2019s cast away.\nGods, gods! \u2019Tis strange that from their cold\u2019st neglect\nMy love should kindle to inflam\u2019d respect.\nThy dowerless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,\nIs queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:\nNot all the dukes of waterish Burgundy\nCan buy this unpriz\u2019d precious maid of me.\nBid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:\nThou losest here, a better where to find.\n\nLEAR.\nThou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we\nHave no such daughter, nor shall ever see\nThat face of hers again. Therefore be gone\nWithout our grace, our love, our benison.\nCome, noble Burgundy.\n\n [_Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester and\n Attendants._]\n\nFRANCE.\nBid farewell to your sisters.\n\nCORDELIA.\nThe jewels of our father, with wash\u2019d eyes\nCordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;\nAnd like a sister am most loath to call\nYour faults as they are nam\u2019d. Love well our father:\nTo your professed bosoms I commit him:\nBut yet, alas, stood I within his grace,\nI would prefer him to a better place.\nSo farewell to you both.\n\nREGAN.\nPrescribe not us our duties.\n\nGONERIL.\nLet your study\nBe to content your lord, who hath receiv\u2019d you\nAt fortune\u2019s alms. You have obedience scanted,\nAnd well are worth the want that you have wanted.\n\nCORDELIA.\nTime shall unfold what plighted cunning hides:\nWho covers faults, at last shame derides.\nWell may you prosper.\n\nFRANCE.\nCome, my fair Cordelia.\n\n [_Exeunt France and Cordelia._]\n\nGONERIL.\nSister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly appertains\nto us both. I think our father will hence tonight.\n\nREGAN.\nThat\u2019s most certain, and with you; next month with us.\n\nGONERIL.\nYou see how full of changes his age is; the observation we have made of\nit hath not been little: he always loved our sister most; and with what\npoor judgement he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.\n\nREGAN.\n\u2019Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever but slenderly known\nhimself.\n\nGONERIL.\nThe best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must we look\nfrom his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted\ncondition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and\ncholeric years bring with them.\n\nREGAN.\nSuch unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent\u2019s\nbanishment.\n\nGONERIL.\nThere is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him.\nPray you let us hit together: if our father carry authority with such\ndisposition as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.\n\nREGAN.\nWe shall further think of it.\n\nGONERIL.\nWe must do something, and i\u2019 th\u2019 heat.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. A Hall in the Earl of Gloucester\u2019s Castle.\n\n Enter Edmund with a letter.\n\nEDMUND.\nThou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law\nMy services are bound. Wherefore should I\nStand in the plague of custom, and permit\nThe curiosity of nations to deprive me?\nFor that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines\nLag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base?\nWhen my dimensions are as well compact,\nMy mind as generous, and my shape as true\nAs honest madam\u2019s issue? Why brand they us\nWith base? With baseness? bastardy? Base, base?\nWho, in the lusty stealth of nature, take\nMore composition and fierce quality\nThan doth within a dull stale tired bed\nGo to the creating a whole tribe of fops\nGot \u2019tween asleep and wake? Well then,\nLegitimate Edgar, I must have your land:\nOur father\u2019s love is to the bastard Edmund\nAs to the legitimate: fine word: legitimate!\nWell, my legitimate, if this letter speed,\nAnd my invention thrive, Edmund the base\nShall top the legitimate. I grow, I prosper.\nNow, gods, stand up for bastards!\n\n Enter Gloucester.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nKent banish\u2019d thus! and France in choler parted!\nAnd the King gone tonight! Prescrib\u2019d his pow\u2019r!\nConfin\u2019d to exhibition! All this done\nUpon the gad!\u2014Edmund, how now! What news?\n\nEDMUND.\nSo please your lordship, none.\n\n [_Putting up the letter._]\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWhy so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?\n\nEDMUND.\nI know no news, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWhat paper were you reading?\n\nEDMUND.\nNothing, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nNo? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The\nquality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let\u2019s see. Come,\nif it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.\n\nEDMUND.\nI beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I\nhave not all o\u2019er-read; and for so much as I have perus\u2019d, I find it\nnot fit for your o\u2019er-looking.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nGive me the letter, sir.\n\nEDMUND.\nI shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in part I\nunderstand them, are to blame.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nLet\u2019s see, let\u2019s see!\n\nEDMUND.\nI hope, for my brother\u2019s justification, he wrote this but as an essay,\nor taste of my virtue.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\n[_Reads._] \u2018This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to\nthe best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness\ncannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the\noppression of aged tyranny; who sways not as it hath power, but as it\nis suffered. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father\nwould sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for\never, and live the beloved of your brother EDGAR.\u2019\nHum! Conspiracy? \u2018Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half his\nrevenue.\u2019\u2014My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? A heart and brain\nto breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it?\n\nEDMUND.\nIt was not brought me, my lord, there\u2019s the cunning of it. I found it\nthrown in at the casement of my closet.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nYou know the character to be your brother\u2019s?\n\nEDMUND.\nIf the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but in\nrespect of that, I would fain think it were not.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nIt is his.\n\nEDMUND.\nIt is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHas he never before sounded you in this business?\n\nEDMUND.\nNever, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that,\nsons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father should be as ward\nto the son, and the son manage his revenue.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nO villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain!\nUnnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,\nseek him; I\u2019ll apprehend him. Abominable villain, Where is he?\n\nEDMUND.\nI do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your\nindignation against my brother till you can derive from him better\ntestimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; where, if you\nviolently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a\ngreat gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the heart of his\nobedience. I dare pawn down my life for him, that he hath writ this to\nfeel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThink you so?\n\nEDMUND.\nIf your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us\nconfer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction,\nand that without any further delay than this very evening.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHe cannot be such a monster.\n\nEDMUND.\nNor is not, sure.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nTo his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven and\nearth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you: frame the\nbusiness after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due\nresolution.\n\nEDMUND.\nI will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall find\nmeans, and acquaint you withal.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThese late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though\nthe wisdom of Nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds\nitself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls\noff, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in\npalaces, treason; and the bond cracked \u2019twixt son and father. This\nvillain of mine comes under the prediction; there\u2019s son against father:\nthe King falls from bias of nature; there\u2019s father against child. We\nhave seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery,\nand all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out\nthis villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully.\u2014And\nthe noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his offence, honesty! \u2019Tis\nstrange.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nEDMUND.\nThis is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in\nfortune, often the surfeits of our own behaviour, we make guilty of our\ndisasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains on\nnecessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers\nby spherical predominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an\nenforced obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,\nby a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to\nlay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star. My father\ncompounded with my mother under the dragon\u2019s tail, and my nativity was\nunder Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I\nshould have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament\ntwinkled on my bastardizing.\n\n Enter Edgar.\n\nPat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue is\nvillainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o\u2019Bedlam.\u2014O, these eclipses\ndo portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi.\n\nEDGAR.\nHow now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation are you in?\n\nEDMUND.\nI am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what\nshould follow these eclipses.\n\nEDGAR.\nDo you busy yourself with that?\n\nEDMUND.\nI promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of\nunnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth,\ndissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and\nmaledictions against King and nobles; needless diffidences, banishment\nof friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not\nwhat.\n\nEDGAR.\nHow long have you been a sectary astronomical?\n\nEDMUND.\nCome, come! when saw you my father last?\n\nEDGAR.\nThe night gone by.\n\nEDMUND.\nSpake you with him?\n\nEDGAR.\nAy, two hours together.\n\nEDMUND.\nParted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him, by word nor\ncountenance?\n\nEDGAR.\nNone at all.\n\nEDMUND.\nBethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my entreaty\nforbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of\nhis displeasure; which at this instant so rageth in him that with the\nmischief of your person it would scarcely allay.\n\nEDGAR.\nSome villain hath done me wrong.\n\nEDMUND.\nThat\u2019s my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed\nof his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my lodging,\nfrom whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak: pray ye, go;\nthere\u2019s my key. If you do stir abroad, go armed.\n\nEDGAR.\nArmed, brother?\n\nEDMUND.\nBrother, I advise you to the best; I am no honest man if there be any\ngood meaning toward you: I have told you what I have seen and heard.\nBut faintly; nothing like the image and horror of it: pray you, away!\n\nEDGAR.\nShall I hear from you anon?\n\nEDMUND.\nI do serve you in this business.\n\n [_Exit Edgar._]\n\nA credulous father! and a brother noble,\nWhose nature is so far from doing harms\nThat he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty\nMy practices ride easy!

When he returns from hunting,\nI will not speak with him; say I am sick.\nIf you come slack of former services,\nYou shall do well; the fault of it I\u2019ll answer.\n\n [_Horns within._]\n\nOSWALD.\nHe\u2019s coming, madam; I hear him.\n\nGONERIL.\nPut on what weary negligence you please,\nYou and your fellows; I\u2019d have it come to question:\nIf he distaste it, let him to our sister,\nWhose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,\nNot to be overruled. Idle old man,\nThat still would manage those authorities\nThat he hath given away!

That which ordinary men are fit\nfor, I am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence.\n\nLEAR.\nHow old art thou?\n\nKENT.\nNot so young, sir, to love a woman for singing; nor so old to dote on\nher for anything: I have years on my back forty-eight.\n\nLEAR.\nFollow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I\nwill not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner! Where\u2019s my knave? my\nfool?

But where\u2019s my fool? I have not seen him this two\ndays.\n\nKNIGHT.\nSince my young lady\u2019s going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined\naway.\n\nLEAR.\nNo more of that; I have noted it well.

Nay, an thou canst not\nsmile as the wind sits, thou\u2019lt catch cold shortly: there, take my\ncoxcomb: why, this fellow has banish\u2019d two on\u2019s daughters, and did the\nthird a blessing against his will; if thou follow him, thou must needs\nwear my coxcomb. How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two\ndaughters!\n\nLEAR.\nWhy, my boy?\n\nFOOL.\nIf I gave them all my living, I\u2019d keep my coxcombs myself. There\u2019s\nmine; beg another of thy daughters.\n\nLEAR.\nTake heed, sirrah, the whip.\n\nFOOL.\nTruth\u2019s a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out, when the Lady\nBrach may stand by the fire and stink.\n\nLEAR.\nA pestilent gall to me!\n\nFOOL.\nSirrah, I\u2019ll teach thee a speech.\n\nLEAR.\nDo.\n\nFOOL.\nMark it, nuncle:\n    Have more than thou showest,\n    Speak less than thou knowest,\n    Lend less than thou owest,\n    Ride more than thou goest,\n    Learn more than thou trowest,\n    Set less than thou throwest;\n    Leave thy drink and thy whore,\n    And keep in-a-door,\n    And thou shalt have more\n    Than two tens to a score.\n\nKENT.\nThis is nothing, fool.\n\nFOOL.\nThen \u2019tis like the breath of an unfee\u2019d lawyer, you gave me nothing\nfor\u2019t. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?\n\nLEAR.\nWhy, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.\n\nFOOL.\n[_to Kent._] Prythee tell him, so much the rent of his land comes to:\nhe will not believe a fool.\n\nLEAR.\nA bitter fool.\n\nFOOL.\nDost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a\nsweet one?\n\nLEAR.\nNo, lad; teach me.\n\nFOOL.\n   That lord that counsell\u2019d thee\n     To give away thy land,\n   Come place him here by me,\n     Do thou for him stand.\n   The sweet and bitter fool\n     Will presently appear;\n   The one in motley here,\n     The other found out there.\n\nLEAR.\nDost thou call me fool, boy?\n\nFOOL.\nAll thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born with.\n\nKENT.\nThis is not altogether fool, my lord.\n\nFOOL.\nNo, faith; lords and great men will not let me; if I had a monopoly\nout, they would have part on\u2019t and ladies too, they will not let me\nhave all the fool to myself; they\u2019ll be snatching. Nuncle, give me an\negg, and I\u2019ll give thee two crowns.\n\nLEAR.\nWhat two crowns shall they be?\n\nFOOL.\nWhy, after I have cut the egg i\u2019 the middle and eat up the meat, the\ntwo crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i\u2019 the middle and\ngav\u2019st away both parts, thou bor\u2019st thine ass on thy back o\u2019er the\ndirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gav\u2019st thy\ngolden one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped\nthat first finds it so.\n[_Singing._]\n   Fools had ne\u2019er less grace in a year;\n     For wise men are grown foppish,\n   And know not how their wits to wear,\n     Their manners are so apish.\n\nLEAR.\nWhen were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?\n\nFOOL.\nI have used it, nuncle, e\u2019er since thou mad\u2019st thy daughters thy\nmothers; for when thou gav\u2019st them the rod, and put\u2019st down thine own\nbreeches,\n[_Singing._]\n   Then they for sudden joy did weep,\n     And I for sorrow sung,\n   That such a king should play bo-peep,\n     And go the fools among.\nPrythee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie; I\nwould fain learn to lie.\n\nLEAR.\nAn you lie, sirrah, we\u2019ll have you whipped.\n\nFOOL.\nI marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are: they\u2019ll have me whipped\nfor speaking true; thou\u2019lt have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I\nam whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind o\u2019thing than\na fool: and yet I would not be thee, nuncle: thou hast pared thy wit\no\u2019both sides, and left nothing i\u2019 the middle: here comes one o\u2019 the\nparings.\n\n Enter Goneril.\n\nLEAR.\nHow now, daughter?

Sir,\nI had thought, by making this well known unto you,\nTo have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,\nBy what yourself too late have spoke and done,\nThat you protect this course, and put it on\nBy your allowance; which if you should, the fault\nWould not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,\nWhich, in the tender of a wholesome weal,\nMight in their working do you that offence\nWhich else were shame, that then necessity\nWill call discreet proceeding.\n\nFOOL.\nFor you know, nuncle,\n   The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long\n   That it\u2019s had it head bit off by it young.\nSo out went the candle, and we were left darkling.\n\nLEAR.\nAre you our daughter?\n\nGONERIL.\nCome, sir,\nI would you would make use of that good wisdom,\nWhereof I know you are fraught; and put away\nThese dispositions, which of late transform you\nFrom what you rightly are.\n\nFOOL.\nMay not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?

Epicurism and lust\nMakes it more like a tavern or a brothel\nThan a grac\u2019d palace. The shame itself doth speak\nFor instant remedy. Be, then, desir\u2019d\nBy her that else will take the thing she begs\nA little to disquantity your train;\nAnd the remainder that shall still depend,\nTo be such men as may besort your age,\nWhich know themselves, and you.\n\nLEAR.\nDarkness and devils!\nSaddle my horses; call my train together.\nDegenerate bastard!

O most small fault,\nHow ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!\nWhich, like an engine, wrench\u2019d my frame of nature\nFrom the fix\u2019d place; drew from my heart all love,\nAnd added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!\n[_Striking his head._] Beat at this gate that let thy folly in\nAnd thy dear judgement out!

Blasts and fogs upon thee!\nTh\u2019untented woundings of a father\u2019s curse\nPierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,\nBeweep this cause again, I\u2019ll pluck ye out,\nAnd cast you with the waters that you lose\nTo temper clay. Ha! Let it be so.\nI have another daughter,\nWho, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:\nWhen she shall hear this of thee, with her nails\nShe\u2019ll flay thy wolvish visage.

While I may scape\nI will preserve myself: and am bethought\nTo take the basest and most poorest shape\nThat ever penury in contempt of man,\nBrought near to beast: my face I\u2019ll grime with filth,\nBlanket my loins; elf all my hair in knots,\nAnd with presented nakedness outface\nThe winds and persecutions of the sky.\nThe country gives me proof and precedent\nOf Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,\nStrike in their numb\u2019d and mortified bare arms\nPins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;\nAnd with this horrible object, from low farms,\nPoor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,\nSometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,\nEnforce their charity.

Full oft \u2019tis seen\nOur means secure us, and our mere defects\nProve our commodities.

Bless thee, master!\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nIs that the naked fellow?\n\nOLD MAN.\nAy, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThen prythee get thee away. If for my sake\nThou wilt o\u2019ertake us hence a mile or twain,\nI\u2019 the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love,\nAnd bring some covering for this naked soul,\nWhich I\u2019ll entreat to lead me.\n\nOLD MAN.\nAlack, sir, he is mad.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\n\u2019Tis the time\u2019s plague when madmen lead the blind.\nDo as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;\nAbove the rest, be gone.\n\nOLD MAN.\nI\u2019ll bring him the best \u2019parel that I have,\nCome on\u2019t what will.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nSirrah naked fellow.\n\nEDGAR.\nPoor Tom\u2019s a-cold.\n[_Aside._] I cannot daub it further.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nCome hither, fellow.\n\nEDGAR.\n[_Aside._] And yet I must.

So, bless thee, master!\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHere, take this purse, thou whom the heaven\u2019s plagues\nHave humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched\nMakes thee the happier. Heavens deal so still!\nLet the superfluous and lust-dieted man,\nThat slaves your ordinance, that will not see\nBecause he does not feel, feel your power quickly;\nSo distribution should undo excess,\nAnd each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?\n\nEDGAR.\nAy, master.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThere is a cliff, whose high and bending head\nLooks fearfully in the confined deep:\nBring me but to the very brim of it,\nAnd I\u2019ll repair the misery thou dost bear\nWith something rich about me: from that place\nI shall no leading need.\n\nEDGAR.\nGive me thy arm:\nPoor Tom shall lead thee.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II.

He\u2019ll not feel wrongs\nWhich tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way\nMay prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;\nHasten his musters and conduct his powers.\nI must change names at home, and give the distaff\nInto my husband\u2019s hands. This trusty servant\nShall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear,\nIf you dare venture in your own behalf,\nA mistress\u2019s command. [_Giving a favour._]\nWear this; spare speech;\nDecline your head.

Where he arrives he moves\nAll hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone\nIn pity of his misery, to dispatch\nHis nighted life; moreover to descry\nThe strength o\u2019 th\u2019enemy.\n\nOSWALD.\nI must needs after him, madam, with my letter.\n\nREGAN.\nOur troops set forth tomorrow; stay with us;\nThe ways are dangerous.\n\nOSWALD.\nI may not, madam:\nMy lady charg\u2019d my duty in this business.\n\nREGAN.\nWhy should she write to Edmund?

I know you are of her bosom.\n\nOSWALD.\nI, madam?\n\nREGAN.\nI speak in understanding; y\u2019are, I know\u2019t:\nTherefore I do advise you take this note:\nMy lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk\u2019d,\nAnd more convenient is he for my hand\nThan for your lady\u2019s. You may gather more.\nIf you do find him, pray you give him this;\nAnd when your mistress hears thus much from you,\nI pray desire her call her wisdom to her.\nSo, fare you well.\nIf you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\nPreferment falls on him that cuts him off.\n\nOSWALD.\nWould I could meet him, madam!

The country near Dover.\n\n Enter Gloucester, and Edgar  dressed like a peasant.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWhen shall I come to the top of that same hill?\n\nEDGAR.\nYou do climb up it now. Look how we labour.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nMethinks the ground is even.\n\nEDGAR.\nHorrible steep.\nHark, do you hear the sea?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nNo, truly.\n\nEDGAR.\nWhy, then, your other senses grow imperfect\nBy your eyes\u2019 anguish.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nSo may it be indeed.\nMethinks thy voice is alter\u2019d; and thou speak\u2019st\nIn better phrase and matter than thou didst.\n\nEDGAR.\nY\u2019are much deceiv\u2019d: in nothing am I chang\u2019d\nBut in my garments.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nMethinks you\u2019re better spoken.\n\nEDGAR.\nCome on, sir; here\u2019s the place. Stand still. How fearful\nAnd dizzy \u2019tis to cast one\u2019s eyes so low!\nThe crows and choughs that wing the midway air\nShow scarce so gross as beetles. Half way down\nHangs one that gathers samphire\u2014dreadful trade!\nMethinks he seems no bigger than his head.\nThe fishermen that walk upon the beach\nAppear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,\nDiminish\u2019d to her cock; her cock a buoy\nAlmost too small for sight: the murmuring surge\nThat on th\u2019unnumber\u2019d idle pebble chafes\nCannot be heard so high. I\u2019ll look no more;\nLest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\nTopple down headlong.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nSet me where you stand.\n\nEDGAR.\nGive me your hand.\nYou are now within a foot of th\u2019extreme verge.\nFor all beneath the moon would I not leap upright.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nLet go my hand.\nHere, friend, \u2019s another purse; in it a jewel\nWell worth a poor man\u2019s taking.

If Edgar live, O, bless him!\nNow, fellow, fare thee well.\n\nEDGAR.\nGone, sir, farewell.\n\n [_Gloucester leaps, and falls along_]\n\nAnd yet I know not how conceit may rob\nThe treasury of life when life itself\nYields to the theft.

Hear you, sir? speak!\nThus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.\nWhat are you, sir?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nAway, and let me die.\n\nEDGAR.\nHadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\nSo many fathom down precipitating,\nThou\u2019dst shiver\u2019d like an egg: but thou dost breathe;\nHast heavy substance; bleed\u2019st not; speak\u2019st; art sound.\nTen masts at each make not the altitude\nWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell.\nThy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nBut have I fall\u2019n, or no?\n\nEDGAR.\nFrom the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\nLook up a-height, the shrill-gorg\u2019d lark so far\nCannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nAlack, I have no eyes.\nIs wretchedness depriv\u2019d that benefit\nTo end itself by death? \u2019Twas yet some comfort\nWhen misery could beguile the tyrant\u2019s rage\nAnd frustrate his proud will.\n\nEDGAR.\nGive me your arm.\nUp, so. How is\u2019t? Feel you your legs? You stand.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nToo well, too well.\n\nEDGAR.\nThis is above all strangeness.\nUpon the crown o\u2019 the cliff what thing was that\nWhich parted from you?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nA poor unfortunate beggar.\n\nEDGAR.\nAs I stood here below, methought his eyes\nWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\nHorns whelk\u2019d and waved like the enraged sea.\nIt was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,\nThink that the clearest gods, who make them honours\nOf men\u2019s impossibilities, have preserv\u2019d thee.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI do remember now: henceforth I\u2019ll bear\nAffliction till it do cry out itself\n\u2018Enough, enough,\u2019 and die. That thing you speak of,\nI took it for a man; often \u2019twould say,\n\u2018The fiend, the fiend\u2019; he led me to that place.\n\nEDGAR.\nBear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?\n\n Enter Lear, fantastically dressed up with flowers.\n\nThe safer sense will ne\u2019er accommodate\nHis master thus.\n\nLEAR.\nNo, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the King himself.\n\nEDGAR.\nO thou side-piercing sight!\n\nLEAR.\nNature\u2019s above art in that respect. There\u2019s your press money. That\nfellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a clothier\u2019s yard.\nLook, look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of toasted cheese will\ndo\u2019t. There\u2019s my gauntlet; I\u2019ll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown\nbills. O, well flown, bird! i\u2019 the clout, i\u2019 the clout. Hewgh! Give the\nword.\n\nEDGAR.\nSweet marjoram.\n\nLEAR.\nPass.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI know that voice.\n\nLEAR.\nHa! Goneril with a white beard! They flattered me like a dog; and told\nme I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say\n\u2018ay\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 to everything I said \u2018ay\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 to was no good\ndivinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me\nchatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found\n\u2019em, there I smelt \u2019em out. Go to, they are not men o\u2019 their words:\nthey told me I was everything; \u2019tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThe trick of that voice I do well remember:\nIs\u2019t not the King?\n\nLEAR.\nAy, every inch a king.\nWhen I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\nI pardon that man\u2019s life. What was thy cause?\nAdultery? Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:\nThe wren goes to\u2019t, and the small gilded fly\nDoes lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive;\nFor Gloucester\u2019s bastard son was kinder to his father\nThan my daughters got \u2019tween the lawful sheets.\nTo\u2019t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.\nBehold yond simp\u2019ring dame,\nWhose face between her forks presages snow;\nThat minces virtue, and does shake the head\nTo hear of pleasure\u2019s name.\nThe fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to\u2019t with a more riotous\nappetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all\nabove. But to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath is all the\nfiend\u2019s; there\u2019s hell, there\u2019s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit;\nburning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give\nme an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination.\nThere\u2019s money for thee.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nO, let me kiss that hand!\n\nLEAR.\nLet me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nO ruin\u2019d piece of nature, this great world\nShall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?\n\nLEAR.\nI remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?\nNo, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I\u2019ll not love.\nRead thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWere all the letters suns, I could not see one.\n\nEDGAR.\nI would not take this from report,\nIt is, and my heart breaks at it.\n\nLEAR.\nRead.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWhat, with the case of eyes?\n\nLEAR.\nO, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in\nyour purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light, yet\nyou see how this world goes.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI see it feelingly.\n\nLEAR.\nWhat, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes. Look with\nthine ears. See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief. Hark, in\nthine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which\nis the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer\u2019s dog bark at a beggar?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nAy, sir.\n\nLEAR.\nAnd the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great\nimage of authority: a dog\u2019s obeyed in office.\nThou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\nWhy dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;\nThou hotly lusts to use her in that kind\nFor which thou whipp\u2019st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.\nThrough tatter\u2019d clothes great vices do appear;\nRobes and furr\u2019d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,\nAnd the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;\nArm it in rags, a pygmy\u2019s straw does pierce it.\nNone does offend, none, I say none; I\u2019ll able \u2019em;\nTake that of me, my friend, who have the power\nTo seal the accuser\u2019s lips. Get thee glass eyes,\nAnd like a scurvy politician, seem\nTo see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:\nPull off my boots: harder, harder, so.\n\nEDGAR.\nO, matter and impertinency mix\u2019d!\nReason in madness!\n\nLEAR.\nIf thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.\nI know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester.\nThou must be patient; we came crying hither:\nThou know\u2019st the first time that we smell the air\nWe wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nAlack, alack the day!\n\nLEAR.\nWhen we are born, we cry that we are come\nTo this great stage of fools. This a good block:\nIt were a delicate stratagem to shoe\nA troop of horse with felt. I\u2019ll put\u2019t in proof\nAnd when I have stol\u2019n upon these son-in-laws,\nThen kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\n\n Enter a Gentleman with Attendants.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nO, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,\nYour most dear daughter\u2014\n\nLEAR.\nNo rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even\nThe natural fool of fortune. Use me well;\nYou shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;\nI am cut to the brains.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nYou shall have anything.\n\nLEAR.\nNo seconds? All myself?\nWhy, this would make a man a man of salt,\nTo use his eyes for garden water-pots,\nAy, and for laying autumn\u2019s dust.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nGood sir.\n\nLEAR.\nI will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.\nWhat! I will be jovial. Come, come,\nI am a king, my masters, know you that.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nYou are a royal one, and we obey you.\n\nLEAR.\nThen there\u2019s life in\u2019t. Come, and you get it,\nYou shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!\n\n [_Exit running. Attendants follow._]\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nA sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,\nPast speaking of in a king!

What\u2019s your will?\n\nEDGAR.\nDo you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nMost sure and vulgar.\nEveryone hears that, which can distinguish sound.\n\nEDGAR.\nBut, by your favour,\nHow near\u2019s the other army?\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nNear and on speedy foot; the main descry\nStands on the hourly thought.\n\nEDGAR.\nI thank you sir, that\u2019s all.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nThough that the queen on special cause is here,\nHer army is mov\u2019d on.\n\nEDGAR.\nI thank you, sir.\n\n [_Exit Gentleman._]\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nYou ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;\nLet not my worser spirit tempt me again\nTo die before you please.\n\nEDGAR.\nWell pray you, father.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nNow, good sir, what are you?\n\nEDGAR.\nA most poor man, made tame to fortune\u2019s blows;\nWho, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,\nAm pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,\nI\u2019ll lead you to some biding.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHearty thanks:\nThe bounty and the benison of heaven\nTo boot, and boot.\n\n Enter Oswald.\n\nOSWALD.\nA proclaim\u2019d prize! Most happy!\nThat eyeless head of thine was first fram\u2019d flesh\nTo raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,\nBriefly thyself remember. The sword is out\nThat must destroy thee.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nNow let thy friendly hand\nPut strength enough to\u2019t.\n\n [_Edgar interposes._]\n\nOSWALD.\nWherefore, bold peasant,\nDar\u2019st thou support a publish\u2019d traitor? Hence;\nLest that th\u2019infection of his fortune take\nLike hold on thee. Let go his arm.\n\nEDGAR.\nChill not let go, zir, without vurther \u2019casion.\n\nOSWALD.\nLet go, slave, or thou diest!\n\nEDGAR.\nGood gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volke pass. An chud ha\u2019 bin\nzwaggered out of my life, \u2019twould not ha\u2019 bin zo long as \u2019tis by a\nvortnight.

Come! No matter vor your foins.\n\n [_They fight, and Edgar knocks him down._]\n\nOSWALD.\nSlave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.\nIf ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;\nAnd give the letters which thou find\u2019st about me\nTo Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out\nUpon the British party. O, untimely death!\n\n [_Dies._]\n\nEDGAR.\nI know thee well.

He\u2019s dead; I am only sorry\nHe had no other deathsman. Let us see:\nLeave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.\nTo know our enemies\u2019 minds, we rip their hearts,\nTheir papers is more lawful.\n[_Reads._] \u2018Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have many\nopportunities to cut him off: if your will want not, time and place\nwill be fruitfully offered. There is nothing done if he return the\nconqueror: then am I the prisoner, and his bed my gaol; from the\nloathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your\nlabour. \u2018Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant, \u2018Goneril.\u2019\nO indistinguish\u2019d space of woman\u2019s will!\nA plot upon her virtuous husband\u2019s life,\nAnd the exchange my brother!
