Messina.\n\n\n\n\n\nACT I\n\nSCENE I. Before Leonato\u2019s House.\n\n      Enter Leonato, Hero, Beatrice and others, with a Messenger.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night\n      to Messina.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left\n      him.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      But few of any sort, and none of name.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full\n      numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on\n      a young Florentine called Claudio.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro.\n      He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the\n      figure of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better\n      bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy\n      in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough\n      without a badge of bitterness.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Did he break out into tears?\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      In great measure.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those\n      that are so washed; how much better is it to weep at joy than to\n      joy at weeping!\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      I know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the army\n      of any sort.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      What is he that you ask for, niece?\n\n\n      HERO.\n      My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      O! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the\n      flight; and my uncle\u2019s fool, reading the challenge, subscribed\n      for Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how\n      many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he\n      killed? for, indeed, I promised to eat all of his killing.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he\u2019ll be\n      meet with you, I doubt it not.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it; he is a very\n      valiant trencher-man; he hath an excellent stomach.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      And a good soldier too, lady.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all honourable\n      virtues.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      It is so indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the\n      stuffing,\u2014well, we are all mortal.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war\n      betwixt Signior Benedick and her; they never meet but there\u2019s a\n      skirmish of wit between them.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his\n      five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed\n      with one! so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let\n      him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for\n      it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable\n      creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new\n      sworn brother.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      Is\u2019t possible?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of\n      his hat; it ever changes with the next block.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      No; and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is\n      his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a\n      voyage with him to the devil?\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner caught\n      than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help\n      the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost\n      him a thousand pound ere he be cured.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      I will hold friends with you, lady.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Do, good friend.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      You will never run mad, niece.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      No, not till a hot January.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      Don Pedro is approached.\n\n\n      Enter Don Pedro, Don John, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar and\n      Others.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble: the\n      fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for\n      trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart\n      from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your\n      daughter.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Her mother hath many times told me so.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this what you are,\n      being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for\n      you are like an honourable father.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on\n      her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick: nobody\n      marks you.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      What! my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food\n      to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to\n      disdain if you come in her presence.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all\n      ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart\n      that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled\n      with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of\n      your humour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow\n      than a man swear he loves me.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      God keep your Ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or\n      other shall scape a predestinate scratched face.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Scratching could not make it worse, and \u2019twere such a face as\n      yours were.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a\n      continuer. But keep your way, i\u2019 God\u2019s name; I have done.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      You always end with a jade\u2019s trick: I know you of old.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      That is the sum of all, Leonato: Signior Claudio, and Signior\n      Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him\n      we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays\n      some occasion may detain us longer: I dare swear he is no\n      hypocrite, but prays from his heart.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. [_To Don John_]\n      Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to the Prince\n      your brother, I owe you all duty.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank you.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Please it your Grace lead on?\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio._]\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I noted her not; but I looked on her.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Is she not a modest young lady?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple\n      true judgment; or would you have me speak after my custom, as\n      being a professed tyrant to their sex?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Why, i\u2019 faith, methinks she\u2019s too low for a high praise, too\n      brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise; only\n      this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she\n      is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do\n      not like her.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me truly how thou\n      likest her.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Can the world buy such a jewel?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad\n      brow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a\n      good hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key\n      shall a man take you, to go in the song?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter:\n      there\u2019s her cousin and she were not possessed with a fury,\n      exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last\n      of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have\n      you?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn to the contrary,\n      if Hero would be my wife.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Is\u2019t come to this, in faith? Hath not the world one man but he\n      will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of\n      threescore again? Go to, i\u2019 faith; and thou wilt needs thrust thy\n      neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays.\n\n\n      Re-enter Don Pedro.\n\n\n      Look! Don Pedro is returned to seek you.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to\n      Leonato\u2019s?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      I charge thee on thy allegiance.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man; I would\n      have you think so; but on my allegiance mark you this, on my\n      allegiance: he is in love. With who? now that is your Grace\u2019s\n      part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato\u2019s short\n      daughter.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      If this were so, so were it uttered.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Like the old tale, my lord: \u2018it is not so, nor \u2019twas not so; but\n      indeed, God forbid it should be so.\u2019\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be\n      otherwise.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      By my troth, I speak my thought.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      That I love her, I feel.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      That she is worthy, I know.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      That I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she\n      should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me:\n      I will die in it at the stake.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I\n      likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a\n      recheat winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible\n      baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them\n      the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust\n      none; and the fine is,\u2014for the which I may go the finer,\u2014I will\n      live a bachelor.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with\n      love: prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get\n      again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker\u2019s pen\n      and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of\n      blind Cupid.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a\n      notable argument.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he\n      that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Well, as time shall try: \u2018In time the savage bull doth bear the\n      yoke.\u2019\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it,\n      pluck off the bull\u2019s horns and set them in my forehead; and let\n      me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write,\n      \u2018Here is good horse to hire,\u2019 let them signify under my sign\n      \u2018Here you may see Benedick the married man.\u2019\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt\n      quake for this shortly.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I look for an earthquake too then.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good\n      Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato\u2019s: commend me to him and tell\n      him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made great\n      preparation.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so I\n      commit you\u2014\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      To the tuition of God: from my house, if I had it,\u2014\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      The sixth of July: your loving friend, Benedick.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime\n      guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on\n      neither: ere you flout old ends any further, examine your\n      conscience: and so I leave you.\n\n\n      [_Exit._]\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      My liege, your Highness now may do me good.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,\n      And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn\n      Any hard lesson that may do thee good.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Hath Leonato any son, my lord?\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      No child but Hero; she\u2019s his only heir.\n      Dost thou affect her, Claudio?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      O! my lord,\n      When you went onward on this ended action,\n      I looked upon her with a soldier\u2019s eye,\n      That lik\u2019d, but had a rougher task in hand\n      Than to drive liking to the name of love;\n      But now I am return\u2019d, and that war-thoughts\n      Have left their places vacant, in their rooms\n      Come thronging soft and delicate desires,\n      All prompting me how fair young Hero is,\n      Saying, I lik\u2019d her ere I went to wars.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Thou wilt be like a lover presently,\n      And tire the hearer with a book of words.\n      If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,\n      And I will break with her, and with her father,\n      And thou shalt have her. Was\u2019t not to this end\n      That thou began\u2019st to twist so fine a story?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      How sweetly you do minister to love,\n      That know love\u2019s grief by his complexion!\n      But lest my liking might too sudden seem,\n      I would have salv\u2019d it with a longer treatise.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      What need the bridge much broader than the flood?\n      The fairest grant is the necessity.\n      Look, what will serve is fit: \u2019tis once, thou lov\u2019st,\n      And I will fit thee with the remedy.\n      I know we shall have revelling tonight:\n      I will assume thy part in some disguise,\n      And tell fair Hero I am Claudio;\n      And in her bosom I\u2019ll unclasp my heart,\n      And take her hearing prisoner with the force\n      And strong encounter of my amorous tale:\n      Then after to her father will I break;\n      And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.\n      In practice let us put it presently.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nSCENE II. A room in Leonato\u2019s house.\n\n      Enter Leonato and Antonio, meeting.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      How now, brother? Where is my cousin your son? Hath he provided\n      this music?\n\n\n      ANTONIO.\n      He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange\n      news that you yet dreamt not of.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Are they good?\n\n\n      ANTONIO.\n      As the event stamps them: but they have a good cover; they show\n      well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a\n      thick-pleached alley in my orchard, were thus much overheard by a\n      man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my\n      niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a\n      dance; and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the\n      present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.\n\n\n      LEONATO. Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?\n\n\n      ANTONIO.\n      A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and question him\n      yourself.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself: but I\n      will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better\n      prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and\n      tell her of it.\n\n\n      [_Several persons cross the stage._]\n\n\n      Cousins, you know what you have to do. O! I cry you mercy,\n      friend; go you with me, and I will use your skill. Good cousin,\n      have a care this busy time.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nSCENE III. Another room in Leonato\u2019s house.\n\n      Enter Don John and Conrade.\n\n\n      CONRADE.\n      What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out of measure sad?\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore the\n      sadness is without limit.\n\n\n      CONRADE.\n      You should hear reason.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      And when I have heard it, what blessings brings it?\n\n\n      CONRADE.\n      If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      I wonder that thou (being as thou say\u2019st thou art, born under\n      Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying\n      mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have\n      cause, and smile at no man\u2019s jests; eat when I have stomach, and\n      wait for no man\u2019s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no\n      man\u2019s business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his\n      humour.\n\n\n      CONRADE.\n      Yea; but you must not make the full show of this till you may do\n      it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your\n      brother, and he hath ta\u2019en you newly into his grace; where it is\n      impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that\n      you make yourself: it is needful that you frame the season for\n      your own harvest.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace; and\n      it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a\n      carriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said\n      to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a\n      plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and\n      enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in\n      my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I\n      would do my liking: in the meantime, let me be that I am, and\n      seek not to alter me.\n\n\n      CONRADE. Can you make no use of your discontent?\n\n\n      DON JOHN. I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes\n      here?\n\n\n      Enter Borachio.\n\n\n      What news, Borachio?\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      I came yonder from a great supper: the Prince your brother is\n      royally entertained by Leonato; and I can give you intelligence\n      of an intended marriage.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for\n      a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      Marry, it is your brother\u2019s right hand.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Who? the most exquisite Claudio?\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      Even he.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks he?\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room,\n      comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference:\n      I whipt me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that\n      the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her,\n      give her to Count Claudio.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Come, come; let us thither: this may prove food to my\n      displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my\n      overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way.\n      You are both sure, and will assist me?\n\n\n      CONRADE. To the death, my lord.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the greater that I am\n      subdued. Would the cook were of my mind! Shall we go to prove\n      what\u2019s to be done?\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      We\u2019ll wait upon your Lordship.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\nSCENE I. A hall in Leonato\u2019s house.\n\n      Enter Leonato, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice and others.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Was not Count John here at supper?\n\n\n      ANTONIO.\n      I saw him not.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am\n      heart-burned an hour after.\n\n\n      HERO.\n      He is of a very melancholy disposition.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      He were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way\n      between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image, and says\n      nothing; and the other too like my lady\u2019s eldest son, evermore\n      tattling.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Then half Signior Benedick\u2019s tongue in Count John\u2019s mouth, and\n      half Count John\u2019s melancholy in Signior Benedick\u2019s face\u2014\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his\n      purse, such a man would win any woman in the world if a\u2019 could\n      get her good will.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou\n      be so shrewd of thy tongue.\n\n\n      ANTONIO.\n      In faith, she\u2019s too curst.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God\u2019s sending that\n      way; for it is said, \u2018God sends a curst cow short horns;\u2019 but to\n      a cow too curst he sends none.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at\n      him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord! I could not\n      endure a husband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in\n      the woollen.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      You may light on a husband that hath no beard.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him\n      my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a\n      youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that\n      is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a\n      man, I am not for him: therefore I will even take sixpence in\n      earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Well then, go you into hell?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      No; but to the gate; and there will the Devil meet me, like an\n      old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say, \u2018Get you to heaven,\n      Beatrice, get you to heaven; here\u2019s no place for you maids.\u2019 So\n      deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens: he\n      shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as\n      the day is long.\n\n\n      ANTONIO.\n      [_To Hero_.] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your\n      father.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Yes, faith; it is my cousin\u2019s duty to make curtsy, and say,\n      \u2018Father, as it please you:\u2019\u2014 but yet for all that, cousin, let\n      him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy, and say,\n      \u2018Father, as it please me.\u2019\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it\n      not grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant\n      dust? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?\n      No, uncle, I\u2019ll none: Adam\u2019s sons are my brethren; and truly, I\n      hold it a sin to match in my kindred.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Daughter, remember what I told you: if the Prince do solicit you\n      in that kind, you know your answer.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in\n      good time: if the Prince be too important, tell him there is\n      measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me,\n      Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a\n      measure, and a cinquepace: the first suit is hot and hasty, like\n      a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly\n      modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes\n      Repentance, and with his bad legs, falls into the cinquepace\n      faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      I have a good eye, uncle: I can see a church by daylight.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.\n\n\n      Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, Don John,\n      Borachio, Margaret, Ursula and Others, masked.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Lady, will you walk about with your friend?\n\n\n      HERO.\n      So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, I am yours\n      for the walk; and especially when I walk away.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      With me in your company?\n\n\n      HERO.\n      I may say so, when I please.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      And when please you to say so?\n\n\n      HERO.\n      When I like your favour; for God defend the lute should be like\n      the case!\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      My visor is Philemon\u2019s roof; within the house is Jove.\n\n\n      HERO.\n      Why, then, your visor should be thatch\u2019d.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Speak low, if you speak love.\n\n\n      [_Takes her aside._]\n\n\n      BALTHASAR.\n      Well, I would you did like me.\n\n\n      MARGARET.\n      So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many ill qualities.\n\n\n      BALTHASAR.\n      Which is one?\n\n\n      MARGARET.\n      I say my prayers aloud.\n\n\n      BALTHASAR.\n      I love you the better; the hearers may cry Amen.\n\n\n      MARGARET.\n      God match me with a good dancer!\n\n\n      BALTHASAR.\n      Amen.\n\n\n      MARGARET.\n      And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done! Answer,\n      clerk.\n\n\n      BALTHASAR.\n      No more words: the clerk is answered.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      I know you well enough: you are Signior Antonio.\n\n\n      ANTONIO.\n      At a word, I am not.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      I know you by the waggling of your head.\n\n\n      ANTONIO.\n      To tell you true, I counterfeit him.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very man.\n      Here\u2019s his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he.\n\n\n      ANTONIO.\n      At a word, I am not.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      Come, come; do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit?\n      Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he: graces will\n      appear, and there\u2019s an end.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Will you not tell me who told you so?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      No, you shall pardon me.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Nor will you not tell me who you are?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Not now.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the\n      \u2018Hundred Merry Tales.\u2019 Well, this was Signior Benedick that said\n      so.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      What\u2019s he?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      I am sure you know him well enough.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Not I, believe me.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Did he never make you laugh?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I pray you, what is he?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Why, he is the Prince\u2019s jester: a very dull fool; only his gift\n      is in devising impossible slanders: none but libertines delight\n      in him; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his\n      villainy; for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they\n      laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet: I would\n      he had boarded me!\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      When I know the gentleman, I\u2019ll tell him what you say.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Do, do: he\u2019ll but break a comparison or two on me; which,\n      peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into\n      melancholy; and then there\u2019s a partridge wing saved, for the fool\n      will eat no supper that night. [_Music within_.] We must follow\n      the leaders.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      In every good thing.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next\n      turning.\n\n\n      [_Dance. Then exeunt all but Don John, Borachio and Claudio._]\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father\n      to break with him about it. The ladies follow her and but one\n      visor remains.\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Are you not Signior Benedick?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      You know me well; I am he.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Signior, you are very near my brother in his love: he is\n      enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him from her; she is no\n      equal for his birth: you may do the part of an honest man in it.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      How know you he loves her?\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      I heard him swear his affection.\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      So did I too; and he swore he would marry her tonight.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Come, let us to the banquet.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt Don John and Borachio._]\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Thus answer I in name of Benedick,\n      But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.\n      \u2019Tis certain so; the Prince wooes for himself.\n      Friendship is constant in all other things\n      Save in the office and affairs of love:\n      Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues;\n      Let every eye negotiate for itself\n      And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch\n      Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.\n      This is an accident of hourly proof,\n      Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!\n\n\n      Re-enter Benedick.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Count Claudio?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Yea, the same.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Come, will you go with me?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Whither?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Even to the next willow, about your own business, Count. What\n      fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like a\n      usurer\u2019s chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant\u2019s scarf? You\n      must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      I wish him joy of her.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Why, that\u2019s spoken like an honest drovier: so they sell bullocks.\n      But did you think the Prince would have served you thus?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      I pray you, leave me.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Ho! now you strike like the blind man: \u2019twas the boy that stole\n      your meat, and you\u2019ll beat the post.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      If it will not be, I\u2019ll leave you.\n\n\n      [_Exit._]\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Alas! poor hurt fowl. Now will he creep into sedges. But, that my\n      Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The Prince\u2019s fool!\n      Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but\n      so I am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it is the\n      base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world\n      into her person, and so gives me out. Well, I\u2019ll be revenged as I\n      may.\n\n\n      Re-enter Don Pedro.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Now, signior, where\u2019s the Count? Did you see him?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him\n      here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I\n      think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of\n      this young lady; and I offered him my company to a willow tree,\n      either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him\n      up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      To be whipped! What\u2019s his fault?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      The flat transgression of a school-boy, who, being overjoy\u2019d with\n      finding a bird\u2019s nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in\n      the stealer.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland\n      too; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he\n      might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his\n      bird\u2019s nest.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say\n      honestly.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the gentleman that\n      danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      O! she misused me past the endurance of a block: an oak but with\n      one green leaf on it would have answered her: my very visor began\n      to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I\n      had been myself, that I was the Prince\u2019s jester, that I was\n      duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such\n      impossible conveyance upon me, that I stood like a man at a mark,\n      with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every\n      word stabs: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,\n      there were no living near her; she would infect to the north\n      star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all\n      that Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have\n      made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to\n      make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the\n      infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would\n      conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as\n      quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose\n      because they would go thither; so indeed, all disquiet, horror\n      and perturbation follow her.\n\n\n      Re-enter Claudio, Beatrice, Hero and Leonato.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Look! here she comes.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Will your Grace command me any service to the world\u2019s end? I will\n      go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can\n      devise to send me on; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the\n      furthest inch of Asia; bring you the length of Prester John\u2019s\n      foot; fetch you a hair off the Great Cham\u2019s beard; do you any\n      embassage to the Pygmies, rather than hold three words\u2019\n      conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me?\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      None, but to desire your good company.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      O God, sir, here\u2019s a dish I love not: I cannot endure my Lady\n      Tongue.\n\n\n      [_Exit._]\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him use for it,\n      a double heart for a single one: marry, once before he won it of\n      me with false dice, therefore your Grace may well say I have lost\n      it.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the\n      mother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me\n      to seek.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Why, how now, Count! wherefore are you sad?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Not sad, my lord.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      How then? Sick?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Neither, my lord.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well; but\n      civil Count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous\n      complexion.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      I\u2019 faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though, I\u2019ll be\n      sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I have\n      wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won; I have broke with her\n      father, and, his good will obtained; name the day of marriage,\n      and God give thee joy!\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes: his\n      Grace hath made the match, and all grace say Amen to it!\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Speak, Count, \u2019tis your cue.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were but little happy,\n      if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours: I\n      give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss, and\n      let not him speak neither.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side\n      of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      And so she doth, cousin.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes everyone to the world but I,\n      and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a\n      husband!\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      I would rather have one of your father\u2019s getting. Hath your Grace\n      ne\u2019er a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if\n      a maid could come by them.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Will you have me, lady?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days: your\n      Grace is too costly to wear every day. But, I beseech your Grace,\n      pardon me; I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you;\n      for out of question, you were born in a merry hour.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star\n      danced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy!\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      I cry you mercy, uncle. By your Grace\u2019s pardon.\n\n\n      [_Exit._]\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      By my troth, a pleasant spirited lady.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      There\u2019s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord: she is\n      never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then, for I have\n      heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and\n      waked herself with laughing.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      O! by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      She were an excellent wife for Benedick.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      O Lord! my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk\n      themselves mad.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Count Claudio, when mean you to go to church?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Tomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all his\n      rites.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night;\n      and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing; but, I warrant\n      thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the\n      interim undertake one of Hercules\u2019 labours, which is, to bring\n      Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of\n      affection the one with the other. I would fain have it a match;\n      and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister\n      such assistance as I shall give you direction.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights\u2019 watchings.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      And I, my lord.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      And you too, gentle Hero?\n\n\n      HERO.\n      I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good\n      husband.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus\n      far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved\n      valour, and confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humour\n      your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I,\n      with your two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in\n      despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in\n      love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an\n      archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods.\n      Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nSCENE II. Another room in Leonato\u2019s house.\n\n      Enter Don John and Borachio.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me: I\n      am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his\n      affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this\n      marriage?\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no dishonesty shall\n      appear in me.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Show me briefly how.\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in the\n      favour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      I remember.\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to\n      look out at her lady\u2019s chamber window.\n\n\n      DON JOHN. What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the Prince\n      your brother; spare not to tell him, that he hath wronged his\n      honour in marrying the renowned Claudio,\u2014whose estimation do you\n      mightily hold up,\u2014to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      What proof shall I make of that?\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero,\n      and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Only to despite them, I will endeavour anything.\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      Go then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count\n      Claudio alone: tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend\n      a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as\u2014in love of your\n      brother\u2019s honour, who hath made this match, and his friend\u2019s\n      reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of\n      a maid,\u2014that you have discovered thus. They will scarcely believe\n      this without trial: offer them instances, which shall bear no\n      less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me\n      call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them\n      to see this the very night before the intended wedding: for in\n      the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be\n      absent; and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero\u2019s\n      disloyalty, that jealousy shall be called assurance, and all the\n      preparation overthrown.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in\n      practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a\n      thousand ducats.\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame\n      me.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      I will presently go learn their day of marriage.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nSCENE III. Leonato\u2019s Garden.\n\n      Enter Benedick.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Boy!\n\n\n      Enter a Boy.\n\n\n      BOY.\n      Signior?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      In my chamber window lies a book; bring it hither to me in the\n      orchard.\n\n\n      BOY.\n      I am here already, sir.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.\n\n\n      [_Exit Boy._]\n\n\n      I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a\n      fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he\n      hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the\n      argument of his own scorn by falling in love: and such a man is\n      Claudio. I have known, when there was no music with him but the\n      drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor and the\n      pipe: I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to\n      see a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving\n      the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to\n      the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is he\n      turned orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet,\n      just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted, and see with\n      these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn but\n      love may transform me to an oyster; but I\u2019ll take my oath on it,\n      till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a\n      fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am\n      well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in\n      one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall\n      be, that\u2019s certain; wise, or I\u2019ll none; virtuous, or I\u2019ll never\n      cheapen her; fair, or I\u2019ll never look on her; mild, or come not\n      near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an\n      excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it\n      please God. Ha! the Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in\n      the arbour.\n\n\n      [_Withdraws._]\n\n\n      Enter Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio, followed by Balthasar and\n      Musicians.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Come, shall we hear this music?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Yea, my good lord.

Sits the wind in that corner?\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it but that\n      she loves him with an enraged affection: it is past the infinite\n      of thought.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Maybe she doth but counterfeit.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Faith, like enough.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      O God! counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of passion came\n      so near the life of passion as she discovers it.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Why, what effects of passion shows she?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO. [_Aside_] Bait the hook well: this fish will bite.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      What effects, my lord? She will sit you; [_To Claudio_] You heard\n      my daughter tell you how.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      She did, indeed.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      How, how, I pray you? You amaze me: I would have thought her\n      spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially against Benedick.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      [_Aside_] I should think this a gull, but that the white-bearded\n      fellow speaks it: knavery cannot, sure, hide itself in such\n      reverence.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      [_Aside_] He hath ta\u2019en the infection: hold it up.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      No; and swears she never will: that\u2019s her torment.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      \u2019Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: \u2018Shall I,\u2019 says she,\n      \u2018that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I\n      love him?\u2019\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for\n      she\u2019ll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her\n      smock till she have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us\n      all.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your\n      daughter told us of.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      O! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found\n      Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      That.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      O! she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at\n      herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she\n      knew would flout her: \u2018I measure him,\u2019 says she, \u2018by my own\n      spirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I\n      love him, I should.\u2019\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart,\n      tears her hair, prays, curses; \u2018O sweet Benedick! God give me\n      patience!\u2019\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      She doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so\n      much overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will\n      do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will\n      not discover it.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      To what end? he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor\n      lady worse.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      And he should, it were an alms to hang him. She\u2019s an excellent\n      sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      And she is exceeding wise.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      In everything but in loving Benedick.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      O! my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we\n      have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry\n      for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      I would she had bestowed this dotage on me; I would have daffed\n      all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you, tell\n      Benedick of it, and hear what he will say.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Were it good, think you?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die if he\n      love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and\n      she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath\n      of her accustomed crossness.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      She doth well: if she should make tender of her love, \u2019tis very\n      possible he\u2019ll scorn it; for the man,\u2014as you know all,\u2014hath a\n      contemptible spirit.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      He is a very proper man.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      He hath indeed a good outward happiness.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      \u2019Fore God, and in my mind, very wise.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      And I take him to be valiant.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of quarrels you may\n      say he is wise; for either he avoids them with great discretion,\n      or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      If he do fear God, a\u2019 must necessarily keep peace: if he break\n      the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and\n      trembling.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems\n      not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for\n      your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Nay, that\u2019s impossible: she may wear her heart out first.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool\n      the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would\n      modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good\n      a lady.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      [_Aside_] If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust\n      my expectation.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      [_Aside_] Let there be the same net spread for her; and that must\n      your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be, when\n      they hold one an opinion of another\u2019s dotage, and no such matter:\n      that\u2019s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb\n      show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt Don Pedro, Claudio and Leonato._]\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      [_Advancing from the arbour._] This can be no trick: the\n      conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from\n      Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it seems her affections have\n      their full bent. Love me? why, it must be requited. I hear how I\n      am censured: they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive\n      the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die\n      than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry: I\n      must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their detractions,\n      and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair: \u2019tis a\n      truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: \u2019tis so, I cannot\n      reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no\n      addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I\n      will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd\n      quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so\n      long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man\n      loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.\n      Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain\n      awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the world must be\n      peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I\n      should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this\n      day! she\u2019s a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.\n\n\n      Enter Beatrice.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to\n      thank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      You take pleasure then in the message?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife\u2019s point, and choke\n      a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior: fare you well.\n\n\n      [_Exit._]\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Ha! \u2018Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner,\u2019\n      there\u2019s a double meaning in that. \u2018I took no more pains for those\n      thanks than you took pains to thank me,\u2019 that\u2019s as much as to\n      say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do\n      not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am\n      a Jew. I will go get her picture.\n\n\n      [_Exit._]\n\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\nSCENE I. Leonato\u2019s Garden.\n\n      Enter Hero, Margaret and Ursula.\n\n\n      HERO.\n      Good Margaret, run thee to the parlour;\n      There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice\n      Proposing with the Prince and Claudio:\n      Whisper her ear, and tell her, I and Ursala\n      Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse\n      Is all of her; say that thou overheard\u2019st us,\n      And bid her steal into the pleached bower,\n      Where honey-suckles, ripen\u2019d by the sun,\n      Forbid the sun to enter; like favourites,\n      Made proud by princes, that advance their pride\n      Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her,\n      To listen our propose. This is thy office;\n      Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.\n\n\n      MARGARET.\n      I\u2019ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.\n\n\n      [_Exit._]\n\n\n      HERO.\n      Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,\n      As we do trace this alley up and down,\n      Our talk must only be of Benedick:\n      When I do name him, let it be thy part\n      To praise him more than ever man did merit.\n      My talk to thee must be how Benedick\n      Is sick in love with Beatrice: of this matter\n      Is little Cupid\u2019s crafty arrow made,\n      That only wounds by hearsay.\n\n\n      Enter Beatrice behind.\n\n\n      Now begin;\n      For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs\n      Close by the ground, to hear our conference.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      The pleasant\u2019st angling is to see the fish\n      Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,\n      And greedily devour the treacherous bait:\n      So angle we for Beatrice; who even now\n      Is couched in the woodbine coverture.\n      Fear you not my part of the dialogue.\n\n\n      HERO.\n      Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing\n      Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.\n\n\n      [_They advance to the bower._]\n\n\n      No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;\n      I know her spirits are as coy and wild\n      As haggards of the rock.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      But are you sure\n      That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?\n\n\n      HERO.\n      So says the Prince, and my new-trothed lord.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?\n\n\n      HERO.\n      They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;\n      But I persuaded them, if they lov\u2019d Benedick,\n      To wish him wrestle with affection,\n      And never to let Beatrice know of it.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman\n      Deserve as full as fortunate a bed\n      As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?\n\n\n      HERO.\n      O god of love! I know he doth deserve\n      As much as may be yielded to a man;\n      But Nature never fram\u2019d a woman\u2019s heart\n      Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;\n      Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,\n      Misprising what they look on, and her wit\n      Values itself so highly, that to her\n      All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,\n      Nor take no shape nor project of affection,\n      She is so self-endear\u2019d.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      Sure I think so;\n      And therefore certainly it were not good\n      She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.\n\n\n      HERO.\n      Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,\n      How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur\u2019d,\n      But she would spell him backward: if fair-fac\u2019d,\n      She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;\n      If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antick,\n      Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;\n      If low, an agate very vilely cut;\n      If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;\n      If silent, why, a block moved with none.\n      So turns she every man the wrong side out,\n      And never gives to truth and virtue that\n      Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.\n\n\n      HERO.\n      No; not to be so odd, and from all fashions,\n      As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.\n      But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,\n      She would mock me into air: O! she would laugh me\n      Out of myself, press me to death with wit.\n      Therefore let Benedick, like cover\u2019d fire,\n      Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:\n      It were a better death than die with mocks,\n      Which is as bad as die with tickling.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.\n\n\n      HERO.\n      No; rather I will go to Benedick,\n      And counsel him to fight against his passion.\n      And, truly, I\u2019ll devise some honest slanders\n      To stain my cousin with. One doth not know\n      How much an ill word may empoison liking.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      O! do not do your cousin such a wrong.\n      She cannot be so much without true judgment,\u2014\n      Having so swift and excellent a wit\n      As she is priz\u2019d to have,\u2014as to refuse\n      So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.\n\n\n      HERO.\n      He is the only man of Italy,\n      Always excepted my dear Claudio.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,\n      Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,\n      For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,\n      Goes foremost in report through Italy.\n\n\n      HERO.\n      Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.\n      When are you married, madam?\n\n\n      HERO.\n      Why, every day, tomorrow. Come, go in:\n      I\u2019ll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel\n      Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      She\u2019s lim\u2019d, I warrant you,\n      We have caught her, madam.\n\n\n      HERO.\n      If it prove so, then loving goes by haps:\n      Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt Hero and Ursula._]\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      [_Advancing._] What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?\n      Stand I condemn\u2019d for pride and scorn so much?\n      Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!\n      No glory lives behind the back of such.\n      And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,\n      Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:\n      If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee\n      To bind our loves up in a holy band;\n      For others say thou dost deserve, and I\n      Believe it better than reportingly.\n\n\n      [_Exit._]\n\n\nSCENE II. A Room in Leonato\u2019s House.\n\n      Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick and Leonato.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I\n      toward Arragon.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      I\u2019ll bring you thither, my lord, if you\u2019ll vouchsafe me.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your\n      marriage, as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear\n      it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from\n      the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth;\n      he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid\u2019s bowstring, and the little\n      hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a\n      bell, and his tongue is the clapper; for what his heart thinks,\n      his tongue speaks.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Gallants, I am not as I have been.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      So say I: methinks you are sadder.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      I hope he be in love.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Hang him, truant! there\u2019s no true drop of blood in him to be\n      truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I have the tooth-ache.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Draw it.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Hang it.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      What! sigh for the tooth-ache?\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Where is but a humour or a worm?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Well, everyone can master a grief but he that has it.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Yet say I, he is in love.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that\n      he hath to strange disguises; as to be a Dutchman today, a\n      Frenchman tomorrow; or in the shape of two countries at once, as\n      a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from\n      the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this\n      foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you\n      would have it appear he is.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old\n      signs: a\u2019 brushes his hat a mornings; what should that bode?\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Hath any man seen him at the barber\u2019s?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      No, but the barber\u2019s man hath been seen with him; and the old\n      ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Nay, a\u2019 rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      That\u2019s as much as to say the sweet youth\u2019s in love.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      The greatest note of it is his melancholy.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      And when was he wont to wash his face?\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear what they say of\n      him.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into a\n      lute-string, and now governed by stops.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude he is\n      in love.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Nay, but I know who loves him.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Yes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for him.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      She shall be buried with her face upwards.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Yet is this no charm for the tooth-ache. Old signior, walk aside\n      with me: I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you,\n      which these hobby-horses must not hear.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt Benedick and Leonato._]\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      \u2019Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts\n      with Beatrice, and then the two bears will not bite one another\n      when they meet.\n\n\n      Enter Don John.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      My lord and brother, God save you!\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Good den, brother.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      If your leisure served, I would speak with you.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      In private?\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      If it please you; yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would\n      speak of concerns him.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      What\u2019s the matter?\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      [_To Claudio._] Means your lordship to be married tomorrow?\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      You know he does.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      I know not that, when he knows what I know.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      You may think I love you not: let that appear hereafter, and aim\n      better at me by that I now will manifest. For my brother, I think\n      he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect\n      your ensuing marriage; surely suit ill-spent and labour ill\n      bestowed!\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Why, what\u2019s the matter?\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      I came hither to tell you; and circumstances shortened,\u2014for she\n      has been too long a talking of,\u2014the lady is disloyal.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Who, Hero?\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      Even she: Leonato\u2019s Hero, your Hero, every man\u2019s Hero.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Disloyal?\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      The word\u2019s too good to paint out her wickedness; I could say, she\n      were worse: think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it.\n      Wonder not till further warrant: go but with me tonight, you\n      shall see her chamber window entered, even the night before her\n      wedding-day: if you love her then, tomorrow wed her; but it would\n      better fit your honour to change your mind.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      May this be so?\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      I will not think it.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      If you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you know. If\n      you will follow me, I will show you enough; and when you have\n      seen more and heard more, proceed accordingly.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her tomorrow, in\n      the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to\n      disgrace her.\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses: bear\n      it coldly but till midnight, and let the issue show itself.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      O day untowardly turned!\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      O mischief strangely thwarting!\n\n\n      DON JOHN.\n      O plague right well prevented!

God hath blessed you with a good\n      name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of Fortune; but to\n      write and read comes by Nature.\n\n\n      SECOND WATCH.\n      Both which, Master Constable,\u2014\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour,\n      sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your\n      writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of\n      such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and\n      fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the\n      lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom\n      men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince\u2019s name.\n\n\n      SECOND WATCH.\n      How, if a\u2019 will not stand?\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently\n      call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of\n      a knave.\n\n\n      VERGES.\n      If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the\n      Prince\u2019s subjects.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince\u2019s subjects.\n      You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the watch\n      to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.\n\n\n      SECOND WATCH.\n      We will rather sleep than talk: we know what belongs to a watch.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I\n      cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your\n      bills be not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses,\n      and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.\n\n\n      SECOND WATCH.\n      How if they will not?\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Why then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you\n      not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you\n      took them for.\n\n\n      SECOND WATCH.\n      Well, sir.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your\n      office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less\n      you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.\n\n\n      SECOND WATCH.\n      If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch pitch\n      will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a\n      thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of\n      your company.\n\n\n      VERGES.\n      You have been always called a merciful man, partner.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who\n      hath any honesty in him.\n\n\n      VERGES.\n      If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse\n      and bid her still it.\n\n\n      SECOND WATCH.\n      How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Why then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with\n      crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes,\n      will never answer a calf when he bleats.\n\n\n      VERGES.\n      \u2019Tis very true.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      This is the end of the charge.

Call me a fool;\n      Trust not my reading nor my observations,\n      Which with experimental seal doth warrant\n      The tenure of my book; trust not my age,\n      My reverence, calling, nor divinity,\n      If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here\n      Under some biting error.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Friar, it cannot be.\n      Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left\n      Is that she will not add to her damnation\n      A sin of perjury: she not denies it.\n      Why seek\u2019st thou then to cover with excuse\n      That which appears in proper nakedness?\n\n\n      FRIAR.\n      Lady, what man is he you are accus\u2019d of?\n\n\n      HERO.\n      They know that do accuse me, I know none;\n      If I know more of any man alive\n      Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,\n      Let all my sins lack mercy!

If they speak but truth of her,\n      These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,\n      The proudest of them shall well hear of it.\n      Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,\n      Nor age so eat up my invention,\n      Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,\n      Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,\n      But they shall find, awak\u2019d in such a kind,\n      Both strength of limb and policy of mind,\n      Ability in means and choice of friends,\n      To quit me of them throughly.\n\n\n      FRIAR.\n      Pause awhile,\n      And let my counsel sway you in this case.\n      Your daughter here the princes left for dead;\n      Let her awhile be secretly kept in,\n      And publish it that she is dead indeed:\n      Maintain a mourning ostentation;\n      And on your family\u2019s old monument\n      Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites\n      That appertain unto a burial.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      What shall become of this?

So will it fare with Claudio:\n      When he shall hear she died upon his words,\n      The idea of her life shall sweetly creep\n      Into his study of imagination,\n      And every lovely organ of her life\n      Shall come apparell\u2019d in more precious habit,\n      More moving, delicate, and full of life\n      Into the eye and prospect of his soul,\n      Than when she liv\u2019d indeed: then shall he mourn,\u2014\n      If ever love had interest in his liver,\u2014\n      And wish he had not so accused her,\n      No, though he thought his accusation true.\n      Let this be so, and doubt not but success\n      Will fashion the event in better shape\n      Than I can lay it down in likelihood.\n      But if all aim but this be levell\u2019d false,\n      The supposition of the lady\u2019s death\n      Will quench the wonder of her infamy:\n      And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,\u2014\n      As best befits her wounded reputation,\u2014\n      In some reclusive and religious life,\n      Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:\n      And though you know my inwardness and love\n      Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio,\n      Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this\n      As secretly and justly as your soul\n      Should with your body.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Being that I flow in grief,\n      The smallest twine may lead me.\n\n\n      FRIAR.\n      \u2019Tis well consented: presently away;\n      For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.\n      Come, lady, die to live: this wedding day\n      Perhaps is but prolong\u2019d: have patience and endure.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt Friar, Hero and Leonato._]\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Yea, and I will weep a while longer.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I will not desire that.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      You have no reason; I do it freely.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Ah! how much might the man deserve of me that would right her.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Is there any way to show such friendship?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      A very even way, but no such friend.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      May a man do it?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      It is a man\u2019s office, but not yours.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is not that\n      strange?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      As strange as the thing I know not.

What think\u2019st thou? Had we fought, I\n      doubt we should have been too young for them.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek you\n      both.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof\n      melancholy, and would fain have it beaten away.

I\n      will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or angry?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat, thou hast\n      mettle enough in thee to kill care.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you charge it\n      against me. I pray you choose another subject.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Nay then, give him another staff: this last was broke cross.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      By this light, he changes more and more: I think he be angry\n      indeed.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Shall I speak a word in your ear?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      God bless me from a challenge!\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      [_Aside to Claudio._] You are a villain, I jest not: I will make\n      it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do\n      me right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a\n      sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear\n      from you.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Well I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      What, a feast, a feast?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      I\u2019 faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf\u2019s-head and a\n      capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knife\u2019s\n      naught. Shall I not find a woodcock too?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      I\u2019ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day. I\n      said, thou hadst a fine wit. \u2018True,\u2019 says she, \u2018a fine little\n      one.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said I, \u2018a great wit.\u2019 \u2018Right,\u2019 said she, \u2018a great\n      gross one.\u2019 \u2018Nay,\u2019 said I, \u2018a good wit.\u2019 \u2018Just,\u2019 said she, \u2018it\n      hurts nobody.\u2019 \u2018Nay,\u2019 said I, \u2018the gentleman is wise.\u2019 \u2018Certain,\u2019\n      said she, \u2018a wise gentleman.\u2019 \u2018Nay,\u2019 said I, \u2018he hath the\n      tongues.\u2019 \u2018That I believe\u2019 said she, \u2018for he swore a thing to me\n      on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning: there\u2019s a\n      double tongue; there\u2019s two tongues.\u2019 Thus did she, an hour\n      together, trans-shape thy particular virtues; yet at last she\n      concluded with a sigh, thou wast the properest man in Italy.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not hate\n      him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man\u2019s daughter\n      told us all.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      All, all; and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the\n      garden.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      But when shall we set the savage bull\u2019s horns on the sensible\n      Benedick\u2019s head?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Yea, and text underneath, \u2018Here dwells Benedick the married man!\u2019\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave you now to\n      your gossip-like humour; you break jests as braggarts do their\n      blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not. My lord, for your many\n      courtesies I thank you: I must discontinue your company. Your\n      brother the bastard is fled from Messina: you have, among you,\n      killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lack-beard there,\n      he and I shall meet; and till then, peace be with him.\n\n\n      [_Exit._]\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      He is in earnest.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      In most profound earnest; and, I\u2019ll warrant you, for the love of\n      Beatrice.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      And hath challenged thee?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Most sincerely.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose\n      and leaves off his wit!\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to such\n      a man.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      But, soft you; let me be: pluck up, my heart, and be sad! Did he\n      not say my brother was fled?\n\n\n      Enter Dogberry, Verges,  and the Watch, with Conrade and\n      Borachio.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne\u2019er weigh\n      more reasons in her balance.

Borachio, one!\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Hearken after their offence, my lord.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Officers, what offence have these men done?\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have\n      spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and\n      lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified\n      unjust things; and to conclude, they are lying knaves.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what\u2019s\n      their offence; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to\n      conclude, what you lay to their charge?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Rightly reasoned, and in his own division; and, by my troth,\n      there\u2019s one meaning well suited.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your\n      answer?

I have deceived even your very\n      eyes: what your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools\n      have brought to light; who, in the night overheard me confessing\n      to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the\n      Lady Hero; how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court\n      Margaret in Hero\u2019s garments; how you disgraced her, when you\n      should marry her. My villainy they have upon record; which I had\n      rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady\n      is dead upon mine and my master\u2019s false accusation; and, briefly,\n      I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      I have drunk poison whiles he utter\u2019d it.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      But did my brother set thee on to this?\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      Yea; and paid me richly for the practice of it.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      He is compos\u2019d and fram\u2019d of treachery: And fled he is upon this\n      villainy.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear\n      In the rare semblance that I lov\u2019d it first.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath\n      reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not\n      forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an\n      ass.\n\n\n      VERGES.\n      Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the sexton too.\n\n\n      Re-enter Leonato, Antonio and the Sexton.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Which is the villain?

Choose your revenge yourself;\n      Impose me to what penance your invention\n      Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn\u2019d I not\n      But in mistaking.\n\n\n      DON PEDRO.\n      By my soul, nor I:\n      And yet, to satisfy this good old man,\n      I would bend under any heavy weight\n      That he\u2019ll enjoin me to.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;\n      That were impossible; but, I pray you both,\n      Possess the people in Messina here\n      How innocent she died; and if your love\n      Can labour aught in sad invention,\n      Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb,\n      And sing it to her bones: sing it tonight.\n      Tomorrow morning come you to my house,\n      And since you could not be my son-in-law,\n      Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,\n      Almost the copy of my child that\u2019s dead,\n      And she alone is heir to both of us:\n      Give her the right you should have given her cousin,\n      And so dies my revenge.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      O noble sir,\n      Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!\n      I do embrace your offer; and dispose\n      For henceforth of poor Claudio.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Tomorrow then I will expect your coming;\n      Tonight I take my leave. This naughty man\n      Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,\n      Who, I believe, was pack\u2019d in all this wrong,\n      Hir\u2019d to it by your brother.\n\n\n      BORACHIO.\n      No, by my soul she was not;\n      Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me;\n      But always hath been just and virtuous\n      In anything that I do know by her.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Moreover, sir,\u2014which, indeed, is not under white and black,\u2014 this\n      plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let\n      it be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard\n      them talk of one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and\n      a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God\u2019s name, the which\n      he hath used so long and never paid, that now men grow\n      hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God\u2019s sake. Pray you,\n      examine him upon that point.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth, and\n      I praise God for you.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      There\u2019s for thy pains.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      God save the foundation!\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.\n\n\n      DOGBERRY.\n      I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your\n      worship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep\n      your worship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to\n      health! I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting\n      may be wished, God prohibit it!

Leonato\u2019s Garden.\n\n      Enter Benedick and Margaret, meeting.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by\n      helping me to the speech of Beatrice.\n\n\n      MARGARET.\n      Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over\n      it; for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it.\n\n\n      MARGARET.\n      To have no man come over me! why, shall I always keep below\n      stairs?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound\u2019s mouth; it catches.\n\n\n      MARGARET.\n      And yours as blunt as the fencer\u2019s foils, which hit, but hurt\n      not.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a woman: and so, I\n      pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.\n\n\n      MARGARET.\n      Give us the swords, we have bucklers of our own.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a vice;\n      and they are dangerous weapons for maids.\n\n\n      MARGARET.\n      Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      And therefore will come.\n\n\n      [_Exit Margaret._]\n\n\n          The god of love,\n           That sits above,\n         And knows me, and knows me,\n            How pitiful I deserve,\u2014\n\n\n      I mean, in singing: but in loving, Leander the good swimmer,\n      Troilus the first employer of panders, and a whole book full of\n      these quondam carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the\n      even road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned\n      over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I cannot show it in\n      rime; I have tried: I can find out no rime to \u2018lady\u2019 but \u2018baby\u2019,\n      an innocent rime; for \u2018scorn,\u2019 \u2018horn\u2019, a hard rime; for \u2018school\u2019,\n      \u2018fool\u2019, a babbling rime; very ominous endings: no, I was not born\n      under a riming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.\n\n\n      Enter Beatrice.\n\n\n      Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Yea, signior; and depart when you bid me.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      O, stay but till then!\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      \u2018Then\u2019 is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere I go, let me go\n      with that I came for; which is, with knowing what hath passed\n      between you and Claudio.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath,\n      and foul breath is noisome; therefore I will depart unkissed.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible\n      is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my\n      challenge, and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will\n      subscribe him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me, for which\n      of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      For them all together; which maintained so politic a state of\n      evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with\n      them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love\n      for me?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      \u2018Suffer love,\u2019 a good epithet! I do suffer love indeed, for I\n      love thee against my will.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you spite\n      it for my sake, I will spite it for yours; for I will never love\n      that which my friend hates.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      It appears not in this confession: there\u2019s not one wise man among\n      twenty that will praise himself.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of good\n      neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he\n      dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and\n      the widow weeps.\n\n\n      BEATRICE. And how long is that think you?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum:\n      therefore is it most expedient for the wise,\u2014if Don Worm, his\n      conscience, find no impediment to the contrary,\u2014to be the trumpet\n      of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising\n      myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy. And now\n      tell me, how doth your cousin?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Very ill.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      And how do you?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Very ill too.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for\n      here comes one in haste.\n\n\n      Enter Ursula.\n\n\n      URSULA.\n      Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder\u2019s old coil at home: it\n      is proved, my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the Prince and\n      Claudio mightily abused; and Don John is the author of all, who\n      is fled and gone. Will you come presently?\n\n\n      BEATRICE.\n      Will you go hear this news, signior?\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy\n      eyes; and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle\u2019s.\n\n\n      [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nSCENE III.

Dost thou think I care for a satire or\n      an epigram? No; if man will be beaten with brains, a\u2019 shall wear\n      nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to\n      marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say\n      against it; and therefore never flout at me for what I have said\n      against it, for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion.\n      For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee; but, in\n      that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised, and love my\n      cousin.\n\n\n      CLAUDIO.\n      I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might\n      have cudgelled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a\n      double-dealer; which, out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin\n      do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Come, come, we are friends. Let\u2019s have a dance ere we are\n      married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives\u2019 heels.\n\n\n      LEONATO.\n      We\u2019ll have dancing afterward.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      First, of my word; therefore play, music! Prince, thou art sad;\n      get thee a wife, get thee a wife: there is no staff more reverent\n      than one tipped with horn.\n\n\n      Enter Messenger.\n\n\n      MESSENGER.\n      My lord, your brother John is ta\u2019en in flight,\n      And brought with armed men back to Messina.\n\n\n      BENEDICK.\n      Think not on him till tomorrow: I\u2019ll devise thee brave\n      punishments for him.
